# about-humans

These are the content files and web files that together make up the website titled *Important Things to Know About Humans*, which can be found at [AboutHumans.net](https://abouthumans.net).

The Notenik app is used to maintain the content files, and to generate the web files. 

If you'd like to open about-humans from within Notenik, you have two options:

+ Use *File > Open* and select the `content/things-to-know` folder, or
+ Use *File > Open Project Folder* and select the top level folder (and then from there double-click on the content folder).
