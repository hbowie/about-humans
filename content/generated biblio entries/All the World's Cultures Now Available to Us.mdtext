During the last 30 years, we have witnessed a historical first: all of the world's cultures are now available to us. 

...for the first time, the sum total of human knowledge is available to us--the knowledge, experience, wisdom and reflection of all major human civilizations--premodern, modern and postmodern--are open to study by anyone.
