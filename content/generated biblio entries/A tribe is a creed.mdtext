Body:

A tribe is not a race, or even a population... a tribe is a creed; it is a team that has agreed upon a set of symbols -- including sacred values -- that identify membership. A creed is a mechanism that glues together disparate small camps and bands of cohabitating humans into a singular identity and shared purpose. Those who know the codes have in their possession a social passport.
