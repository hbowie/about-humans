Body:

We humans have the ability to imagine the future, and to consider how an action today might affect that future. And we have the ability to see a big picture, considering others who might be affected, and to envision second- and third-order consequences of our actions. 

These abilities allow us to put together plans of how we might achieve things of significant scope, that may take long periods to achieve. 

But what's more, and more remarkable, we have the capacity to *care* for future generations, and for those we've never met, and might never meet.
