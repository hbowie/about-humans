It is shallow attention that alerts us to imminent danger: the sudden movement observed out of the corner of an eye, the loud noise coming out of nowhere, sensory input signaling the possible attack of a predator. 

And it is the nature of our immediate environment that tells us how much energy to spend in the current moment on shallow attention. 

Shallow attention and quick responses are often valuable. 

But they cannot be the whole story for humanity.
