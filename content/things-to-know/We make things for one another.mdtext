Body:

We humans have always made things for ourselves and for one another. 

As our technologies and specialized roles have become more complex and more diverse,  the things we make and the ways in which we make them have also become more sophisticated. 

Of course some people provide services rather than products, but it is all part of the process of value creation. 

We live in complex societies with long value chains but, ultimately, all of us are still making things for one another. 

And part of the magic of making things for one another is that, when our economic system is working well, we all end up better off than we would have been had we tried making everything we wanted and needed for ourselves. 

In other words, we each make a profit from our labors, ending up with more than we started with.
