Body:

A meaningful activity is oriented toward a goal, one that, if accomplished, would have an impact on the world — and this usually means that it has an impact on other people. This activity extends across a significant portion of one’s life and has some structure — it’s the sort of thing that one can tell a story about. It often connects to religion and spirituality and often connects to flow (leading to the experience of self-loss) and often brings you into close contact with other people and is often seen as morally virtuous — but none of these additional features are essential.
