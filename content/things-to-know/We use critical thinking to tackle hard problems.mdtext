Body:

Modern society consists of an unfathomable intertwining of large and complex organizations, using a vast array of ever-advancing technologies, and now including over 8 billion humans. 

Working and living together as we do in such a situation, we inevitably encounter hard problems. 

These are generally problems that can be viewed from multiple perspectives, and decisions that often require difficult tradeoffs between competing values and conflicting perspectives. 

In order to come up with the best possible solutions to such problems, we generally employ critical thinking, considering multiple perspectives and alternative answers before reaching a decision.
