The [Four-Way Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four-Way_Test) is one of the [Guiding principles](https://my.rotary.org/en/who-we-are/about-rotary/guiding-principles) of the Rotary organization. 

The Rotary organization describes this as a "nonpartisan and nonsectarian ethical guide... to use for ... personal and professional relationships. 

It is suggested to apply the test to "the things we think, say or do."

The test was originally developed by Herbert J. Taylor in 1932 for application within his own company in order to improve its functioning and its bottom line. 

It was later adopted by the Rotary organization as a way of expanding the circle of trust to the broader business community.
