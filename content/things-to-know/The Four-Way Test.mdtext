The [Four-Way Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four-Way_Test) is one of the [Guiding principles](https://my.rotary.org/en/who-we-are/about-rotary/guiding-principles) of the Rotary organization. 

The Rotary organization describes this as a "nonpartisan and nonsectarian ethical guide... to use for ... personal and professional relationships. 

It is suggested to apply the test to "the things we think, say or do."
