Body:

In order to live and work together within cooperative groups, humans (as well as other primates) have evolved a sense of what's fair and what's not fair, and have a strong preference for the former. 

Fair play includes the following:

+ truth-telling;
+ rewards that are commensurate with contributions; 
+ inclusive decision-making;
+ mutual benefits;
+ firm and quick enforcement of group norms.
