Body:

Gods and religions are [[things we have made]] for ourselves. 

This does not necessarily mean that they are bad, or inauthentic. 

There are many religions, and even the same religion can be practiced in different ways by different groups, and different individuals. 

Religions can be organized along very [[egalitarian]] lines, or in a very [[hierarchical]] fashion. And religions generally rely on shared [[stories]] and [[values]], and have inspired a great deal of [[art]]. And most religions rely on [[social networks]] organized at the local level. 

The concept of God is often used as a symbolic embodiment of shared ideals, a sort of placeholder for our common aspirations. Images surrounding God (such as the Christian cross, or the Star of David) are often used as forms of [[tribal]] identification.
