Body:

All of the various [[organizing structures]] have their uses, but people often form strong preferences for some structures over others. 

For example those with strong egalitarian leanings may favor [[multicultural societies]].

Others are much more comfortable with a [[hierarchical structure]]. 

However modern human society needs all of these different structures in order to function well, so we humans are better off learning some flexibility around these things.
