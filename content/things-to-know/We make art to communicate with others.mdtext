We make works of art in order to communicate with others. 

Many works of art incorporate [[stories]], or elements of stories. 

Art is a form of human communication. Itâ€™s a way for a specific, unique individual to communicate a very nuanced set of thoughts, feelings and perspectives to a broad audience, and to elicit some resonant and sympathetic response from those viewing/hearing/reading the created work. 

Genuine works of art have some sort of depth to them: meaningful elements that lie beneath the surface of the work, waiting for the observer to discover them. In this way, art calls forth and rewards deeper sorts of attention.
