> We form long-term, nonreproductive unions with other humans. This is exceedingly rare in the animal kingdom, but it is universal in us. As a consequence of having friends, we assemble ourselves into social networks, and here, too, the particular ways we do this are universal. The mathematical patterns of friendship are the same around the world.
