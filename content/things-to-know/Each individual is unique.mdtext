Although all humans share certain genetic similarities, and although we operate in groups, each individual human is unique. 

This starts with a unique appearance for each of us, such that we can recognize friends and family and colleagues as individuals when we encounter them. 

But each of us is also a unique bundle of capabilities, experiences and preferences.

Note that [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) represents a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. Estimates of this number range from 100 â€“ 250, with 150 being a commonly accepted value. 

This number may perhaps provide an effective limit to the number of people we can each know as individuals.
