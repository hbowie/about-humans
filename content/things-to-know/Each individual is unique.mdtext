Although all humans share certain genetic similarities, and although we operate in groups, each individual human is unique. 

This starts with a unique appearance for each of us, such that we can recognize friends and family and colleagues when we encounter them. 

But each of us is also a unique bundle of capabilities, experiences and preferences.
