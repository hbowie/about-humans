Body:

As groups became larger and more technologically advanced, they practiced more [[specialization]] of [[roles]]. 

Peers within each role would typically compare notes with one another in order to discover [[what works]], and to share that knowledge with others.

They would also develop specialized [[vocabularies]] to aid them in comparing notes and describing what works, and what doesn't. 

Written communication then allowed them to:

+ Share information asynchronously, over expanses of time and space;
+ Precisely describe [[theories]] and [[experiments]] in order to have them validated (or proven invalid) by peers. 

These peer groups of experts thus enabled expansion of our pool of collective scientific knowledge, as well as of practical [[inventions]]. 

And then this written knowledge could be accurately passed down from generation to generation. 

This organizational paradigm encourages loyalty to shared truth, and to precise measurements and formulas, and to the processes of experimentation and review.
