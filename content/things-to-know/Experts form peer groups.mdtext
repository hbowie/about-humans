Body:

As groups became larger and more technologically advanced, they practiced more [[specialization]] of [[roles]]. 

Peers within each role would typically compare notes with one another in order to discover [[what works]], and to share that knowledge with others.

They would also develop specialized [[vocabularies]] to aid them in comparing notes and describing what works, and what doesn't. 

Written communication then allowed them to:

+ Share information asynchronously, over expanses of time and space;
+ Precisely describe [[theories]] and [[experiments]] in order to have them validated (or proven invalid) by peers. 

These peer groups of experts thus enabled expansion of our pool of collective scientific knowledge, as well as of practical [[inventions]]. 

And then this written knowledge could be accurately passed down from generation to generation.
