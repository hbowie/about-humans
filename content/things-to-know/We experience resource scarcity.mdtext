Body:

Resource scarcity is a driver for adaptation. If there is more than enough for everybody, then there is no reason to further adapt. 

Humans need food, water, clothing, housing and some means of adapting to the local climate (heating, cooling, etc.). 

But we generally need other things to function within our local and chosen groups, such as means of transportation and communication. 

For some of us, these things often seem plentiful. And for some theorizers, there is no reason why there shouldn't be plenty for everyone. 

But despite our continued advances in science and technology, and our corresponding improvements in human productivity, our resource needs always seem to grow apace. 

So it seems wise to accept that some degree of resource scarcity will always be a factor for us.
