Referenced In: Individuals adapt via autonomy

Body:

This model describes how learners typically proceed through five general phases as part of a complete education in a new skill. 

This model describes the learning journey as one starting with complete dependence on cultural prescription, and then proceeding to ever-greater levels of individual autonomy, providing the practitioner with increasing freedom to adapt general rules to the specifics of a situation.
