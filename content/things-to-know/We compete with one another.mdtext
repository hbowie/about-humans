Body:

We generally [[cooperate]] with others within groups, if the groups are functioning well. 

And as we [[nest groups]] within one another, the size of the groups, and the scope of the cooperation, tends to increase. 

But we also compete with one another. 

Competition often serves as a form of [[testing]].

Competition can be destructive, as in a fight to the death, or an all-out war of one group against another. 

But competition can also be non-destructive, as in most sports. 

Economic competition is an important element of capitalism and of liberalism more generally. 

However much we wish to live cooperatively with one another, the drive to compete is part of being human, and so we need to productively channel our competitive urges, rather than trying to eliminate them.
