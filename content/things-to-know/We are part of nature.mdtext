Body:

*[Homo Sapiens][human]* is a very special species (more about that later), but we must always remember that we humans are, in some important sense, just one species among many in the family of living things that are coexisting on planet Earth. 

Among other things, this means that we appear in our current form thanks to the long and gradual process of [evolution][].
