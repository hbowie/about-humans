*Homo Sapiens* has adapted to live in almost every part of our globe. You can find us in both tropical and frigid climes, in valleys and on mountains, on warm equatorial beaches and in the land of the midnight sun. 

Humans are able to adapt to their situations and environments using three different mechanisms. 

1. [[Genetic evolution]]
2. [[Cultural change]]
3. [[Individual autonomy]]

It is the availability of all three of these mechanisms that explains our uniquely adaptive nature.
