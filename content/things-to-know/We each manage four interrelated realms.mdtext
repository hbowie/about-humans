Body:

We each must manage:

+ Elements of the outer physical world;
+ Our social relationships with others around us;
+ Our own physical bodies;
+ Our own inner worlds of memories, dreams, beliefs, attitudes and feelings. 

All four of these are interrelated and affect each other.

At different times, and at different stages of development, we may focus more intently on any one of these but, ultimately, we must pay considerable attention to all four.
