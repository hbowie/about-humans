Body:

We devise and conduct tests in order to see if our [[models]] are accurate, and to see if our [[inventions]] work. And then, if the test fails, we go back and revise our models and inventions and try them again. 

Testing and experimentation are important elements of the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method).
