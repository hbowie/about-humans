Body:

The *New Oxford American Dictionary* defines "wonder" as:

> a feeling of surprise mingled with admiration, caused by something beautiful, unexpected, unfamiliar, or inexplicable.

And part of being human is to experience this sense of wonder about the universe around us. 

As we grow and develop, things that once seemed wonderful to us might over time become well known and routine. 

And yet...

No matter how much we learn, how much we develop, wonder always seems to be still available to us, when we stop to look for it.

Because the cosmos — including we humans who occupy one small corner of it — is always in some sense larger and more complex — has more *breadth* and *depth* to it — than any one of us can ever fully absorb.
