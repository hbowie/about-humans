Body:

Humans develop complex and sophisticated languages (including mathematical languages, and programming languages, and other types) and these languages form important parts of our cultures. 

Human languages allow us to reference, not just material objects, but abstract concepts. 

Note that while all humans have the capacity for language, details of a specific language generally vary by culture.
