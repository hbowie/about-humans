Deep attention allows us to focus at length on a complex problem or situation, and to apply our powers of cognition to coming up with understanding and solutions. 

In other words, deep attention helps us to [[figure things out]]. 

Deep attention is an important complement to [[shallow attention]]. 

Deep attention also produces an inner experience of flow, which can be profoundly satisfying to those experiencing it. 

But too much demand for shallow attention deprives us of the ability to pay deep attention.
