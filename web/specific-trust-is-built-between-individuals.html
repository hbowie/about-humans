<p>As we get to know <a href="each-individual-is-unique.html" class="wiki-link">individuals</a> in our <a href="we-live-in-cooperative-groups.html" class="wiki-link">groups</a>, we develop specific levels of trust based on three factors. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Character — if we believe someone has character (or integrity, or authenticity), then we believe they will generally follow the expectations for <a href="we-practice-and-expect-fair-play.html" class="wiki-link">fair play</a>; </p></li>
<li>
<p>Caring — we need to believe that someone actually includes us within their circle of care, that we are someone that they care about enough to offer help when needed; </p></li>
<li>
<p>Competence — if a task requires some sort of <a href="roles-often-provide-for-specialization.html" class="wiki-link">specialization</a>, then we need to believe in a person&#8217;s competence to perform that particular sort of task. </p></li>

<figure class="notenik-quote-attrib"><blockquote><p>There is wide agreement on the basics of the [trust] framework. And what makes it work. </p>

<p>What [Frances] Frei calls &#8220;authenticity&#8221; could also be called honesty, integrity, or character. When people judge your authenticity, they&#8217;re looking at three things! What do you think? What do you say? How do you act? &#8230; If I think you are authentic, and you promise to do something, I trust you will do your best to keep your promise. Because that&#8217;s what authentic people do. </p>

<p>If &#8220;authenticity&#8221; is about you, &#8220;empathy&#8221; is about how you feel about others. Do you care about them? Do you want them to succeed and thrive? Do you really listen to them? If the answer is yes, you are even more trustworthy. Empathy could also be called &#8220;benevolence&#8221; or &#8220;caring.&#8221; </p>

<p>The third element, &#8220;logic,&#8221; is your ability to deliver. It&#8217;s one thing to be honest and caring, but delivering on your promises requires more than good intentions. You need whatever it takes — plans, skills, training, experience, whatever — for you to get the job done. &#8220;Logic&#8221; could also be called &#8220;competence&#8221; or &#8220;capability.&#8221; </p></blockquote><figcaption><p class="quote-from"><a href="wales-jimmy.html" class="wiki-link">Jimmy Wales</a>, 2025, from the book <em><a href="the-seven-rules-of-trust-a-blueprint-for-building-things-that-last.html" class="wiki-link">The Seven Rules of Trust: A Blueprint for Building Things That Last</a></em> </p></figcaption></figure>
