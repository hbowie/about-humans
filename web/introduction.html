<p>For some time now, I&#8217;ve wondered if it would be possible to put together some sort of reasonably comprehensive and useful set of insights about what it means to be human. </p>

<p>This work is my attempt to assemble such a synthesis. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure that such an effort will involve a lot of fumbling around, and will, like its subject, continue to evolve over some significant length of time. </p>

<p>So rather than wait for the work to achieve some sort of finished state prior to publication, I&#8217;m electing to publish incrementally, inviting feedback as I go. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any interest you might have in my little effort. </p>
