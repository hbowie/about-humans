<p>As groups became larger and more technologically advanced, they practiced more <a href="roles-often-provide-for-specialization.html" class="wiki-link">specialization</a> of <a href="groups-define-roles-for-their-members.html" class="wiki-link">roles</a>. </p>

<p>Peers within each role would typically compare notes with one another in order to discover <a href="we-retain-what-works.html" class="wiki-link">what works</a>, and to share that knowledge with others. </p>

<p>They would also develop specialized <a href="we-communicate-via-sophisticated-languages.html" class="wiki-link">vocabularies</a> to aid them in comparing notes and describing what works, and what doesn&#8217;t. </p>

<p>Written communication then allowed them to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Share information asynchronously, over expanses of time and space; </li>
<li>Precisely describe <a href="theories.html" class="wiki-link">theories</a> and <a href="experiments.html" class="wiki-link">experiments</a> in order to have them validated (or proven invalid) by peers. </li>
</ul>

<p>These peer groups of experts thus enabled expansion of our pool of collective scientific knowledge, as well as of practical <a href="we-invent-stuff.html" class="wiki-link">inventions</a>. </p>

<p>And then this written knowledge could be accurately passed down from generation to generation. </p>

<p>This organizational paradigm encourages loyalty to shared truth, and to the processes of experimentation and review. </p>
