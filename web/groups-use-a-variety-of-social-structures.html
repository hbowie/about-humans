<p>VII. <a href="a-web-of-interconnections.html" class="nav-link">A Web of Interconnections </a>&#160;&#8593;</p><h3 id="groupsuseavarietyofsocialstructures" style="clear:both">45. Groups use a variety of social structures.</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve already touched on the importance of <a href="we-live-in-cooperative-groups.html" class="wiki-link">cooperative groups</a> in human life, and we&#8217;ve spoken of <a href="culture-provides-a-groups-operating-system.html" class="wiki-link">culture</a> as providing the operating systems for groups, and we&#8217;ve observed that <a href="groups-are-often-nested.html" class="wiki-link">groups are often nested</a>, with subgroups inside of larger groups. </p>

<p>So now we&#8217;re ready to discuss the differing organizing structures that groups tend to use, depending on their size, compexity and purpose. And along with these differing structures, we will see corresponding realignment of individuals&#8217; loyalties within these different structures. </p>

<p>These structures go from simplest and most fundamental to most complex and expansive. </p>

<p>Note that these are social structures used within organizations, often to organize subgroups. As groups grow in size — including modern states and corporations — they tend to leverage several of these structures, or even all of them. That is, these structures are employed in combination, and no one of these is meant to be used to the exclusion of all others. </p><table>
