<p>We humans need to be taught <a href="we-communicate-via-sophisticated-languages.html" class="wiki-link">language</a> and <a href="values-form-one-element-of-a-groups-culture.html" class="wiki-link">values</a> and other elements of <a href="culture-provides-a-groups-operating-system.html" class="wiki-link">culture</a>, as well as skills needed for <a href="we-use-critical-thinking-to-tackle-hard-problems.html" class="wiki-link">critical thinking</a> and for useful <a href="roles-often-provide-for-specialization.html" class="wiki-link">specialization</a>. </p>

<p>Such education generally continues until the age of at least sixteen, and longer for many intended professions. </p>

<p>Such education starts with the <a href="family-is-the-foundational-paradigm.html" class="wiki-link">family</a>, but larger groups generally contribute to the educational process as well. </p>
