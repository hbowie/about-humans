<p>VIII. <a href="at-our-best....html" class="nav-link">At Our Best&#8230; </a>&#160;&#8593;</p><h3 id="wedonotdemandperfection" style="clear:both">55. We do not demand perfection.</h3>
<p>Although <a href="we-improve-things.html" class="wiki-link">we improve things</a>, and <a href="we-pursue-growth-and-development.html" class="wiki-link">we pursue growth and development</a>, we do not demand perfection, either in the things we make, or in each other. </p>

<p>This is partly because the notion of perfection implies that all desirable qualities in a thing can be resolved so that each one is maximized. In practice, desirable qualities are often in competition with one another, and so necessitate trade-offs. (And so the illusion of perfection can only be obtained by insisting that only a small set of compatible qualities are desirable.) </p>

<p>But it is also because, beyond a certain point, the law of diminishing returns kicks in, and additional application of effort produces ever-smaller returns on investment. </p>
