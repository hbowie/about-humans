<p>Tribes have historically been limited in size by geography (at least prior to digital technology — but let&#8217;s leave that subject for another discussion). </p>

<p>But once groups began to develop written cultures, including stories and symbols and rituals and rules, those writings could be used to bind together groups so large that they crossed oceans and spanned continents. Written culture could also be used to transmit these elements from one generation to the next, allowing such groups to span centuries as well. </p>
