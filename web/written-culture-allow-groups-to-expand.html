<p>Tribes have historically been limited in size by geography (at least prior to digital technology — but let&#8217;s leave that subject for another discussion). </p>

<p>But once groups began to develop written cultures, including stories and symbols and rituals and rules, those writings could be used to bind together groups so large that they crossed oceans and spanned continents. Written culture could also be used to transmit these elements from one generation to the next, allowing such groups to span centuries as well. </p>

<p>Of course, once such cultural elements are written down, they are hard to change, since it is hard to produce an authority and rationale for making such changes. </p>

<p>In modern society, these sorts of groups are generally found in religions and in large bureaucracies. </p>

<blockquote><p>Yet the people here suffered, apparently, from the fact that they were employed not by an educational institution, but by a bureaucratic system. They were all, to a large extent, clerks, neatly bound up in red tape, and, like clerks, they gave themselves the illusion of freedom by discussing and ridiculing the strictures that bound them. Kate thought lovingly of her own university, where one struggled, God knew, against the ancient sins of favoritism, flattery, and simony, but where the modern horrors of bureaucracy had not yet strangled her colleagues or herself. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="cross-amanda.html">Amanda Cross</a>, 1964, from the Novel <a href="in-the-last-analysis.html"><cite>In The Last Analysis</cite></a></p>
