<p>We humans need to be taught <a href="we-communicate-via-sophisticated-languages.html" class="wiki-link">language</a> and <a href="values.html" class="wiki-link">values</a> and other elements of <a href="culture-provides-a-groups-operating-system.html" class="wiki-link">culture</a>, as well as skills needed for <a href="we-use-critical-thinking-to-tackle-hard-problems.html" class="wiki-link">critical thinking</a> and for useful <a href="roles-often-provide-for-specialization.html" class="wiki-link">specialization</a>. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Preach, my dear Sir, a crusade against ignorance; establish and improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen know that the people alone can protect us against these evils [misery by kings, nobles and priests], and that the tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, priests and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in ignorance. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="jefferson-thomas.html">Thomas Jefferson</a>, 13 Aug 1786, from the letter &ldquo;<a href="to-george-wythe-13-august-1786.html">To George Wythe, 13 August 1786</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>All of the great advances in our society have come when we have made investments in other people&#8217;s children. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="putnam-robert.html">Robert Putnam</a>, as quoted in <cite><a href="quotation-from-wtf-whats-the-future-and-why-its-up-to-us.html">WTF: What's the Future and Why It's Up To Us</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>If you think education is expensive, try ignorance. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="bok-derek.html">Derek Bok</a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Education demands a certain daring, a certain independence of mind. We have to teach young people to think. And to teach young people, in order to teach young people to think, you have to teach them to think about everything. There mustn&#8217;t be something they cannot think about. If there&#8217;s something, if there&#8217;s one thing they can&#8217;t think about, then very shortly they can&#8217;t think about anything, you know. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="baldwin-james.html">James Baldwin</a>, 1961, from the interview &ldquo;<a href="studs-terkel-interview.html">Studs Terkel Interview</a>&rdquo;</p>
