<p>We each must manage: </p>
<ul>
<li>Elements of the outer physical world; </li>
<li>Our social relationships with others around us; </li>
<li>Our own physical bodies; </li>
<li>Our own inner worlds of memories, dreams, beliefs, attitudes and feelings. </li>
</ul>

<p>All four of these are interrelated and affect each other. </p>

<p>At different times, and at different stages of development, we may focus more intently on any one of these but, ultimately, we must pay considerable attention to all four. </p>

<blockquote><p>Mastery of the inner world, with a relative contempt for the outer, must inevitably lead to great catastrophe. Mastery of the outer world, to the exclusion of the inner, delivers us over to the demonic forces of the latter, and keeps us barbaric despite all outward forms of culture. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="baynes-cary.html">Cary Baynes</a>, 1931, from the Book <a href="translators-preface-to-the-secret-of-the-golden-flower.html"><cite>Translator's Preface to The Secret of the Golden Flower</cite></a></p>

<blockquote><p>At the personalistic level&#8230; man becomes centrally concerned with peace with his inner self and in the relation of his self to the inner self of others. He becomes concerned with belonging, with being accepted, with knowing the inner side of self and other selves so harmony can come to be, so people as individuals can be at peace with themselves and thus with the world. And when he achieves this, he finds he must become concerned with more than self or other selves, because while he was focusing on the inner self to the exclusion of the external world, his outer world has gone to pot. So now he turns outward to life and to the whole, the total universe. As he does so he begins to see the problems of restoring the balance of life which has been torn asunder by his individualistically oriented, self-seeking climb up the first ladder of existence. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="graves-clare-w..html">Clare W. Graves</a>, 1974, from the Article <a href="the-futurist-human-nature-prepares-for-a-momentous-leap.html">&ldquo;The Futurist: Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap&rdquo;</a></p>
