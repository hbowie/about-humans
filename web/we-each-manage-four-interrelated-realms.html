<p>We each must manage: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Elements of the outer physical world; </li>
<li>
Our social relationships with others around us; </li>
<li>
Our own physical bodies; </li>
<li>
Our own inner worlds of memories, dreams, beliefs, attitudes and feelings. </li>
</ul>

<p>All four of these are interrelated and affect each other. </p>

<p>At different times, and at different stages of development, we may focus more intently on any one of these but, ultimately, we must pay considerable attention to all four. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>There is a myth, sometimes widespread, that a person need only do inner work, in order to be alive like this; that a man is entirely responsible for his own problems; and that to cure himself, he need only change himself … The fact is, a person is so far formed by his surroundings, that his state of harmony depends entirely on his harmony with his surroundings. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="alexander-christopher.html">Christopher Alexander</a>, 1979, from the book <cite><a href="the-timeless-way-of-building.html">The Timeless Way of Building</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>She might yet be able to help him to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion. Without it we are meaningless fragments, half monks, half beasts, unconnected arches that have never joined into a man. With it love is born, and alights on the highest curve, glowing against the gray, sober against the fire. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="forster-e-m..html">E. M. Forster</a>, 1910, from the novel <cite><a href="howards-end.html">Howard's End</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms &#8211; to choose one&#8217;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&#8217;s own way. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="frankl-victor.html">Victor Frankl</a>, 1946, from the book <cite><a href="mans-search-for-meaning.html">Man's Search for Meaning</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Mastery of the inner world, with a relative contempt for the outer, must inevitably lead to great catastrophe. Mastery of the outer world, to the exclusion of the inner, delivers us over to the demonic forces of the latter, and keeps us barbaric despite all outward forms of culture. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="baynes-cary.html">Cary Baynes</a>, 1931, from the book <cite><a href="translators-preface-to-the-secret-of-the-golden-flower.html">Translator's Preface to The Secret of the Golden Flower</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>At the personalistic level&#8230; man becomes centrally concerned with peace with his inner self and in the relation of his self to the inner self of others. He becomes concerned with belonging, with being accepted, with knowing the inner side of self and other selves so harmony can come to be, so people as individuals can be at peace with themselves and thus with the world. And when he achieves this, he finds he must become concerned with more than self or other selves, because while he was focusing on the inner self to the exclusion of the external world, his outer world has gone to pot. So now he turns outward to life and to the whole, the total universe. As he does so he begins to see the problems of restoring the balance of life which has been torn asunder by his individualistically oriented, self-seeking climb up the first ladder of existence. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="graves-clare-w..html">Clare W. Graves</a>, 1974, from the article &ldquo;<a href="the-futurist-human-nature-prepares-for-a-momentous-leap.html">The Futurist: Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap</a>&rdquo;</p>
