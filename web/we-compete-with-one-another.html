<p>We generally <a href="we-live-in-cooperative-groups.html" class="wiki-link">cooperate</a> with others within groups, if the groups are functioning well. </p>

<p>And as we <a href="nest-groups.html" class="wiki-link">nest groups</a> within one another, the size of the groups, and the scope of the cooperation, tends to increase. </p>

<p>But we also compete with one another, and much of our competition is between dissimilar groups. </p>

<p>Competition often serves as a form of <a href="we-perform-tests.html" class="wiki-link">testing</a>. </p>

<p>Competition can be destructive, as in a fight to the death, or an all-out war of one group against another. </p>

<p>But competition can also be non-destructive, as in most sports. </p>

<p>But however much we wish to live cooperatively with one another, the drive to compete is part of being human, and so we need to productively channel our competitive urges, rather than trying to eliminate them. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>So the first biological lesson of history is that life is competition. Competition is not only the life of trade, it is the trade of life — peaceful when food abounds, violent when the mouths outrun the food. Animals eat one another without qualm; civilized men consume one another by due process of law. Cooperation is real, and increases with social development, but mostly because it is a tool and form of competition; we co-operate in our group — our family, community, club, church, party, “race,” or nation — in order to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups. Competing groups have the qualities of competing individuals: acquisitiveness, pugnacity, partisanship, pride. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="durant-will.html">Will Durant</a>, 1968, from the Book <a href="the-lessons-of-history.html"><cite>The Lessons of History</cite></a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Our ancestors found ways to suppress disruptive competition among individuals within groups, so that between-group selection became the primary evolutionary force. This favored group-level coordination in all its forms, including the transmission of learned information across generations. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="wilson-david-sloan.html">David Sloan Wilson</a>, 2019, from the Book <a href="this-view-of-life-completing-the-darwinian-revolution.html"><cite>This View of Life: Completing the Darwinian Revolution</cite></a></p>
