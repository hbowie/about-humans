<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homo Sapiens</a></em> is a very special species (more about that later), but we must always remember that we humans are, in some important sense, just one species among many in the family of living things that are coexisting on planet Earth. </p>

<p>Among other things, this means that we appear in our current form thanks to the long and gradual process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolution</a>. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>On the basis of all the evidence, the closest relative of the human proves to be the chimp. The closest relative of the chimp is the human. Not orangs, but people. Us. Chimps and humans are nearer kin than are chimps and gorillas or any other kinds of ape not of the same species. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="sagan-carl-and-druyan-ann.html">Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan</a>, 1992, from the book <cite><a href="shadows-of-forgotten-ancestors-a-search-for-who-we-are.html">Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors: A Search for Who We Are</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>We were flying over America, and suddenly I saw snow, the first snow we ever saw from orbit. I have never visited America, but I imagined that the arrival of autumn and winter is the same there as in other places, and the process of getting ready for them is the same. And then it struck me that we are all children of our Earth. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="aleksandrov-aleksandr.html">Aleksandr Aleksandrov</a>, 2019, as quoted in <cite><a href="quoted-in-blueprint-the-evolutionary-origins-of-a-good-society.html">Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>I wanted to teach people to listen to the pulse of nature, to partake of the wholeness of life and not forget, under the pressure of their petty destinies, that we are not gods and have not created ourselves but are children of the earth, part of the cosmos. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="hesse-hermann.html">Hermann Hesse</a>, 1904, from the book <cite><a href="peter-camenzind.html">Peter Camenzind</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>History is a fragment of biology: the life of man is a portion of the vicissitudes of organisms on land and sea. Sometimes, wandering alone in the woods on a summer day, we hear or see the movement of a hundred species of flying, leaping, creeping, crawling, burrowing things. The startled animals scurry away at our coming; the birds scatter; the fish disperse in the brook. Suddenly we perceive to what a perilous minority we belong on this impartial planet, and for a moment we feel, as these varied denizens clearly do, that we are passing interlopers in their natural habitat. Then all the chronicles and achievements of man fall humbly into the history and perspective of polymorphous life; all our economic competition, our strife for mates, our hunger and love and grief and war, are akin to the seeking, mating, striving, and suffering that hide under these fallen trees or leaves, or in the waters, or on the boughs. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="durant-will.html">Will Durant</a>, 1968, from the book <cite><a href="the-lessons-of-history.html">The Lessons of History</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Man has long talked somewhat arrogantly about the conquest of nature; now he has the power to achieve his boast. It is our misfortune &#8211; it may well be our final tragedy &#8211; that this power has not been tempered with wisdom, but has been marked by irresponsibility; that there is all too little awareness that man is part of nature, and that the price of conquest may well be the destruction of man himself. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="carson-rachel.html">Rachel Carson</a>, 1962, from the speech &ldquo;<a href="1962-commencement-address-at-scripps-college.html">1962 Commencement Address at Scripps College</a>&rdquo;</p>
