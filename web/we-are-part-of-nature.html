<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homo Sapiens</a></em> is a very special species (more about that later), but we must always remember that we humans are, in some important sense, just one species among many in the family of living things that are coexisting on planet Earth. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>On the basis of all the evidence, the closest relative of the human proves to be the chimp. The closest relative of the chimp is the human. Not orangs, but people. Us. Chimps and humans are nearer kin than are chimps and gorillas or any other kinds of ape not of the same species. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="sagan-carl-and-druyan-ann.html">Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan</a>, 1992, from the book <cite><a href="shadows-of-forgotten-ancestors-a-search-for-who-we-are.html">Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors: A Search for Who We Are</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>We were flying over America, and suddenly I saw snow, the first snow we ever saw from orbit. I have never visited America, but I imagined that the arrival of autumn and winter is the same there as in other places, and the process of getting ready for them is the same. And then it struck me that we are all children of our Earth. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="aleksandrov-aleksandr.html">Aleksandr Aleksandrov</a>, 2019, as quoted in <cite><a href="quoted-in-blueprint-the-evolutionary-origins-of-a-good-society.html">Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>I wanted to teach people to listen to the pulse of nature, to partake of the wholeness of life and not forget, under the pressure of their petty destinies, that we are not gods and have not created ourselves but are children of the earth, part of the cosmos. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="hesse-hermann.html">Hermann Hesse</a>, 1904, from the book <cite><a href="peter-camenzind.html">Peter Camenzind</a></cite></p>
