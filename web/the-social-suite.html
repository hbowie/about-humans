<p>A set of eight traits that have been found to be essential for the formation and maintenance of stable human societies, as described by <a href="christakis-nicholas.html" class="wiki-link">Christakis, Nicholas</a> in his book <em><a href="blueprint-the-evolutionary-origins-of-a-good-society.html" class="wiki-link">Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</a></em>. </p>

<li>The capacity to have and recognize individual identity<br />
<p>Individual identity provides a foundation for love, friendship, and cooperation, allowing people to track who is who across time and place and to faithfully repay kindness offered by others. </p></li>

</main>
<main>
<li>Love for partners and offspring<br />
<p>Love is a particularly distinctive human experience (built on a trait seen in only a few other mammals, namely, the practice of bonding with mates). </p></li>

</main>
<main>
<li>Friendship<br />
<p>We are wired to have friends, not just reproductive partners, and when we form friendships, we modify the social world around us in a way that makes friendliness useful. </p>

<p>Friendship is a fundamental category&#8230; yet scientists have tended to neglect the role friends have played in the life of our species. An extreme focus by our species on kinsip and marriage has obscured the more numerous relationships people have with unrelated friends. These friends are also, after all, the primary members of the social groups we form and live within. </p></li>
