<p>A set of eight traits that have been found to be essential for the formation and maintenance of stable human societies, as described by <a href="christakis-nicholas.html" class="wiki-link">Christakis, Nicholas</a> in his book <em><a href="blueprint-the-evolutionary-origins-of-a-good-society.html" class="wiki-link">Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</a></em>. </p>

The capacity to have and recognize individual identity<br />
<figure class="notenik-quote-attrib"><blockquote><p>Individual identity provides a foundation for love, friendship, and cooperation, allowing people to track who is who across time and place and to faithfully repay kindness offered by others. </p></blockquote><figcaption><p class="quote-from"><a href="christakis-nicholas.html" class="wiki-link">Nicholas Christakis</a>, 2019, from the book <em><a href="blueprint-the-evolutionary-origins-of-a-good-society.html" class="wiki-link">Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</a></em> </p></figcaption></figure>

Love for partners and offspring<br />
<figure class="notenik-quote-attrib"><blockquote><p>Love is a particularly distinctive human experience (built on a trait seen in only a few other mammals, namely, the practice of bonding with mates). </p></blockquote><figcaption><p class="quote-from"><a href="christakis-nicholas.html" class="wiki-link">Nicholas Christakis</a>, 2019, from the book <em><a href="blueprint-the-evolutionary-origins-of-a-good-society.html" class="wiki-link">Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</a></em> </p></figcaption></figure>

Friendship<br />
<figure class="notenik-quote-attrib"><blockquote><p>We are wired to have friends, not just reproductive partners, and when we form friendships, we modify the social world around us in a way that makes friendliness useful. </p></blockquote><figcaption><p class="quote-from"><a href="christakis-nicholas.html" class="wiki-link">Nicholas Christakis</a>, 2019, from the book <em><a href="blueprint-the-evolutionary-origins-of-a-good-society.html" class="wiki-link">Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</a></em> </p></figcaption></figure>

<figure class="notenik-quote-attrib"><blockquote><p>Friendship is a fundamental category&#8230; yet scientists have tended to neglect the role friends have played in the life of our species. An extreme focus by our species on kinship and marriage has obscured the more numerous relationships people have with unrelated friends. These friends are also, after all, the primary members of the social groups we form and live within. </p></blockquote><figcaption><p class="quote-from"><a href="christakis-nicholas.html" class="wiki-link">Nicholas Christakis</a>, 2019, from the book <em><a href="blueprint-the-evolutionary-origins-of-a-good-society.html" class="wiki-link">Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society</a></em> </p></figcaption></figure>

Social networks<br />
<blockquote>

<p>We form long-term, nonreproductive unions with other humans. This is exceedingly rare in the animal kingdom, but it is universal in us. As a consequence of having friends, we assemble ourselves into social networks, and here, too, the particular ways we do this are universal. The mathematical patterns of friendship are the same around the world. </p>
</blockquote>

<li>
Cooperation<br />
<blockquote>

<p>Humans everywhere also cooperate with one another. And this cooperation is supported not only by the fact that we reliably interact with friends rather than strangers within the face-to-face networks we fashion, but also by the fact that we form groups whose boundaries we enforce by coming to like those within the group more than those outside of it. People everywhere choose their friends and prefer their own groups. In turn, cooperation is a crucial predicate for social learning, one of our species’ most powerful inventions. </p>

Preference for one’s own group (that is, “in-group bias”)<br />

<li>
Mild hierarchy (that is, relative egalitarianism)<br />
<blockquote>

<p>And friendship networks and social learning, finally, set the stage for a kind of mild hierarchy in humans in which we accord more prestige to some group members — typically, those who can teach us things or who have many connections — than to others. </p>

Social learning and teaching<br />
<blockquote>

<p>No human has to learn everything on his or her own; we can all rely on others to teach us, a hugely efficient practice present in all cultures. </p>
