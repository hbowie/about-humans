Man is not the only animal who labors; but he is the only one who improves his workmanship. These improvements he effects by Discoveries and Inventions. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="lincoln-abraham.html">Abraham Lincoln</a>, 1858, from the Lecture <a href="lecture-on-discoveries-and-inventions.html">&ldquo;Lecture on Discoveries and Inventions&rdquo;</a></p>
