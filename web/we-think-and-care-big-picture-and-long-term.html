<h3 id="wethinkandcarebigpictureandlong-term" style="clear:both">21. We think and care big picture and long-term.</h3>
<p>We humans have the ability to imagine the future, and to consider how an action today might affect that future. And we have the ability to see a big picture, considering others who might be affected, and to envision second- and third-order consequences of our actions. </p>

<p>These abilities allow us to put together plans of how we might achieve things of significant scope, that may take long periods to achieve. </p>

<p>But what&#8217;s more, and more remarkable, we have the capacity to <em>care</em> for future generations, and for those we&#8217;ve never met, and might never meet. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Many people interpret the invisible hand concept as saying, we should just take our hands off the steering wheel like there’s nothing we should do.  I don’t agree with that.  Humans aren’t designed to accept the world as is, so to just say “whatever” is denying what makes us thrive as a species.  More than any other creature on Earth, we have the capacity to envision a better future and make it a reality.  We are askers of the question, “What kind of world do we want?” And perhaps even more importantly, we can ask the follow-up question, “How do we build that?” </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="hwang-victor.html">Victor Hwang</a>, 2023-08-03, from the Interview <a href="evolution-complexity-and-the-third-way-of-entrepreneurship-a-capstone-conversation-with-victor-hwang.html">&ldquo;Evolution, Complexity, and the Third Way of Entrepreneurship: A Capstone Conversation with Victor Hwang&rdquo;</a></p>
