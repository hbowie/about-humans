<p>We do very little completely on our own, without the company or support or products or services provided by others of our species. </p>

<p>We cooperate with others in our groups in order to get stuff done. </p>

<p>The groups within which we cooperate vary in size, complexity, structure and intent (more on this later), but we are rarely if ever completely divorced from them. </p>

<p>In a way, you can divine our social nature just by looking at any one of us: not especially large, not particularly strong, not terribly fast, not equipped with sharp claws or large teeth, not protected by a strong outer layer of thick skin and hair. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s clear that we have not evolved to survive on our own, but only as part of cooperative groups. </p>
