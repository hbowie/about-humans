<p>Finally, we adapt to varying environments and situations through use of individual autonomy (which is also exercised by subgroups within groups). </p>

<p>Some might refer to this as <em>free will</em>. </p>

<p>Differing cultures may allow, encourage or discourage varying degrees of individual autonomy. </p>

<p>But all of us take advantage of it to some degree. </p>

<p>Our genetics and our group culture(s) provide valuable frameworks for our decision-making, but we humans like to reserve the right to make final decisions for ourselves. </p>

<p>Like a quarterback calling an audible at the line of scrimmage, we need the freedom to respond to emergent situations as they unfold before and around us. </p>

<p>And it is generally this third means of adaptation that enables the second — adaptation via <a href="groups-adapt-via-cultural-change.html" class="wiki-link">cultural change</a> — since most changes in culture start with the exercise of autonomy by individuals. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Maybe bees and ants don&#8217;t mind being thralls to group instincts but people, I feel, do. And so the question that human beings must ask is, &#8220;How do I live my own life and survive, even prosper, while sharing the load of the greater culture?&#8221; </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="mosley-walter.html">Walter Mosley</a>, 2016, from the Book <a href="folding-the-red-into-the-black-developing-a-viable-untopia-for-human-survival-in-the-21st-century.html"><cite>Folding the Red Into the Black: Developing a Viable Untopia for Human Survival in the 21st Century</cite></a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Failure or success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars. But they retain the power of wriggling, of fighting with their star or against it, and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="forster-e-m..html">E. M. Forster</a>, 1910, from the Novel <a href="howards-end.html"><cite>Howard's End</cite></a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="jobs-steve.html">Steve Jobs</a>, 1994, from the Interview <a href="steve-jobs-interview-with-santa-clara-valley-historical-association.html">&ldquo;Steve Jobs Interview with Santa Clara Valley Historical Association&rdquo;</a></p>
