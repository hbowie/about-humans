<p>Modern society consists of an unfathomable intertwining of large and complex organizations, using a vast array of ever-advancing technologies, and now including over 8 billion humans. </p>

<p>Working and living together as we do in such a situation, we inevitably encounter hard problems. </p>

<p>These are generally problems that can be viewed from multiple perspectives, and decisions that often require difficult tradeoffs between competing values and conflicting perspectives. </p>

<p>In order to come up with the best possible solutions to such problems, we generally employ critical thinking, considering multiple perspectives and alternative answers before reaching a decision. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>There is always an easy solution to every human problem &#8211; neat, plausible and wrong. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="mencken-h-l..html">H. L. Mencken</a>, 1920, from the book <cite><a href="prejudices-second-series.html">Prejudices: Second Series</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Mr. Campion was shocked. There are some people to whom muddled thinking and self-deception are the two most unforgivable crimes in the world. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="allingham-margery.html">Margery Allingham</a>, 1938, from the novel <cite><a href="the-fashion-in-shrouds.html">The Fashion in Shrouds</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>The higher up you go in politics &#8211; but I think this is true of any organization &#8211; the more you will be confronted with challenges, problems, issues that do not yield a perfect answer. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="obama-barack.html">Barack Obama</a>, 07 Dec 2020, from the podcast &ldquo;<a href="dare-to-lead-interview-with-barack-obama.html">Dare to Lead Interview with Barack Obama</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>The typical, and primary, root cause of [the Nirvana] AntiPattern is the misguided notion that conflict is bad, and therefore should be avoided at all costs. In reality, conflict in the form of tension &#8230; is a necessary part of any difficult task that involves intelligent people who care about their work. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="brown-william-j.-mccormick-hays-w-and-thomas-scott-w..html">Brown, William J., McCormick, Hays W., Thomas and Scott W.</a>, 1999, from the book <cite><a href="anti-patterns-and-patterns-in-software-configuration-management.html">Anti-Patterns and Patterns in Software Configuration Management</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>It would be a wonderful world were the Simple Truth Thesis true. Our political task simply would be to empower those who know the simple truth, and rebuke the fools who do not. But the Simple Truth Thesis is not true. In fact, it&#8217;s a fairytale—soothing, but ultimately unfit for a serious mind. For any Big Question, there are several defensible positions; it is precisely this feature that makes them big. Of course, to say that a position is defensible is not to say that it&#8217;s true. To oppose the Simple Truth Thesis is not to embrace relativism (which is itself a version of the Simple Truth view), nor is it to give up on the idea that there is truth; it is rather to give up on the view that the truth is always simple. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="aikin-scott-f-and-talisse-robert-b..html">Scott F. Aikin and Robert B. Talisse</a>, 04 Jan 2016, from the blog post &ldquo;<a href="the-myth-of-simple-truths.html">The Myth of Simple Truths</a>&rdquo;</p>
