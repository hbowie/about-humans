<p>Resource scarcity is a driver for adaptation. If there is more than enough for everybody, then there is no reason to further adapt. </p>

<p>Humans need food, water, clothing, housing and some means of coping with the local climate (heating, cooling, etc.). </p>

<p>But we generally need other things to function within our local and chosen groups, such as means of transportation and communication. </p>

<p>And in order to live well, we need time and space and companions and environments conducive to play and enjoyment. </p>

<p>For some of us, these things often seem plentiful. And for some theorizers, there is no reason why there shouldn&#8217;t be plenty for everyone. </p>

<p>But despite our continued advances in science and technology, and our corresponding improvements in human productivity, our resource needs always seem to grow apace. </p>

<p>As observed by [Quinn, Daniel|Daniel Quinn], new technology and techniques that increase food production also generally seem to have the effect of supporting increasing population levels, and increasing population levels then lead to food scarcity. </p>

<p>So unless we can somehow collectively find ways to stabilize and perhaps even decrease our human population levels, continued resource scarcity will likely be a fact of life. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>What is observed in the human population is that intensification of production to feed and increase the population invariably leads to a still greater increase in population. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="quinn-daniel.html">Daniel Quinn</a>, 1996, from the novel <cite><a href="the-story-of-b.html">The Story of B</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Despite its successes, and perhaps because of them, capitalism created, or could not prevent the creation of, the two problems that now threaten its survival: enormous economic inequalities both between and within countries, and the largely worsening if not the destruction of the natural environment. As we have analyzed in a previous chapter, the main cause of these problems is overpopulation in relation to the resources provided by the Earth. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="lianos-theodore-p..html">Theodore P.
