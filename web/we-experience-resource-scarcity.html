<h3 id="weexperienceresourcescarcity" style="clear:both">4. We experience resource scarcity.</h3>
<p>Resource scarcity is a driver for adaptation. If there is more than enough for everybody, then there is no reason to further adapt. </p>

<p>Humans need food, water, clothing, housing and some means of coping with the local climate (heating, cooling, etc.). </p>

<p>But we generally need other things to function within our local and chosen groups, such as means of transportation and communication. </p>

<p>And in order to live well, we need time and space and companions and environments conducive to play and enjoyment. </p>

<p>For some of us, these things often seem plentiful. And for some theorizers, there is no reason why there shouldn&#8217;t be plenty for everyone. </p>

<p>But despite our continued advances in science and technology, and our corresponding improvements in human productivity, our resource needs always seem to grow apace. </p>

<p>So it seems wise to accept that some degree of resource scarcity will always be a factor for us. </p>
