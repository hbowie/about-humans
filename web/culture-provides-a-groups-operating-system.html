<h3 id="cultureprovidesagroupsoperatingsystem" style="clear:both">8. Culture acts as the operating system for a group.</h3>
<p>I wrote earlier about the importance of human <a href="we-live-in-cooperative-groups.html" class="wiki-link">groups</a>. </p>

<p>Humans are flexible enough to operate in many different kinds of groups, for a variety of purposes. </p>

<p>But how does each group know how to function? What are each group&#8217;s rules for how members interact with each other, and how each group interacts with other groups? </p>

<p>Well, unlike other sorts of groups formed by other species, such rules are not hard-wired into our DNA. Nor are they necessarily handed down from a mountaintop. </p>

<p>Instead each group has some sort of culture that functions as a sort of operating system for the group. </p>

<p>A group&#8217;s culture includes knowledge, customs, languages, technology and artifacts that are shared between group members, and passed on from one generation of members to the next. </p>

<p>And these group cultures are malleable, and can be developed and improved over time. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>With this perspective, you can begin to think of yourself as not just a product of your genes, and not just a product of your personal experience, but also as one of many members of your culture who collectively contain a vast repository of information learned and passed down from previous generations. This makes you part of something larger than yourself. The information has not just been passed down, but it has also been <em>winnowed</em> through the generations, leaving us with a set of beliefs and practices that helped us to cohere as groups. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="wilson-david-sloan.html">David Sloan Wilson</a>, 2019, from the Book <a href="this-view-of-life-completing-the-darwinian-revolution.html"><cite>This View of Life: Completing the Darwinian Revolution</cite></a></p>
