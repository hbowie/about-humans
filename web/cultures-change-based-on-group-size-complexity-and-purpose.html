<p>We&#8217;ve already touched on the importance of <a href="we-live-in-cooperative-groups.html" class="wiki-link">cooperative groups</a> in human life, and we&#8217;ve spoken of <a href="culture-provides-a-groups-operating-system.html" class="wiki-link">culture</a> as providing the operating systems for groups, and we&#8217;ve observed that <a href="groups-are-often-nested.html" class="wiki-link">groups are often nested</a>, with subgroups inside of larger groups. </p>

<p>So now we&#8217;re ready to discuss the differing organizational paradigms that groups tend to use, depending on their size, compexity and purpose. And along with these differing structures, we will see corresponding realignment of individuals&#8217; feelings and attitudes within these different structures. </p><table>
