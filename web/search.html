development Wilber Ken|Ken Wilber was the first author I encountered who proposed an integration of these various developmental progressions into a single unifying scheme However much of Ken s take on these levels was heavily influenced by the Spiral Dynamics spiral work done by Clare W Graves graves Don Beck beck and Chris Cowan And Freinacht Hanzi|Hanzi Freinacht provides yet another take on this stuff in his book The Listening Society So what do we mean by a level of development in this context Here s where it gets a little tricky Both in terms of individual development and in terms of sociocultural development these levels seem to emerge in a certain sequence However later levels do not supersede or invalidate earlier levels Rather than replacing previous levels each emergent level expands the complexity and capacity of individuals and societies And so Wilber and Beck and Cowan have tried to use colors to identify the levels rather than numbers in order to avoid giving the impression that later levels are somehow superior to earlier levels At some point along the line though Ken Wilber and the Integral crew decided it was important to change some of the colors I ve listed both the original Spiral Dynamics colors and the newer Integral colors in the table below but in general I will stick with the original colors from Beck and Cowan Also there has been a later tendency to add new higher levels to the upper end of this range I ve not been able to make much sense of these myself so I m omitting them here As we go through these levels we can make use of The Four Quadrants model to see that each level has a particular subjective or intersubjective viewpoint as well as typical social structures that can be identified from an interobjective perspective There s a certain chicken and the egg sort of dilemma we face when trying to disentangle the objective social aspects of a level from its subjective aspects but for me it feels more natural to consider the objective social aspects first so I ll proceed in that manner Also it s worth noting that as we proceed through the levels they tend to alternate between an assertion of individual power

        content: "I originally came across this model in a book by Wilber Ken|Ken Wilber titled A Brief History of Everything It s become a foundational piece of Wilber s Integral Philosophy something he terms AQAL for All Quadrants All Levels But I ve found over the years that the Four Quadrants model can stand on its own and be usefully understood and applied without reference to other pieces of Wilber s philosopy I m going to describe my understanding of this model as it applies to us humans Wilber often describes it in more general broadly philosophical terms In Brief We tend to perceive reality from four different perspectives ofter referred as the four quadrants Understanding these perspectives as four valid and complementary ways of perceiving the world helps us gain a more complete and useful understanding of people and situations An understanding of these four quadrants of perception is useful because it helps us understand that very different views of reality Freudian psychology vs Skinner s behaviorism for example are not contradictory or mutually exclusive but rather are complementary Views from these different perspectives may be equally valid even if they are very different ways of looking at the world The four quadrants are formed by the intersection of two dimensions The first dimension left or right can be expressed as either interior or exterior The second dimension up or down can be expressed as either individual or collective Combining these we get the four quadrants We can think of these as the individual subjective the individual objective the social objective and the social subjective Harari s Distinctions It s worth noting that Yuval Noah Harari in his book Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind uses the terms subjective intersubjective and objective to describe respectively the upper left lower left and right hand sides of the four quadrants defining them like this An objective right hand phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs The subjective upper left is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single individual It disappears or changes if that particular individual changes his or her beliefs The intersubjective lower left is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals If a single individual changes his or her beliefs or even dies it is of little importance However if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs the inter subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear Example of Application from Rob Austin The Four Quadrants model can be applied in all sorts of contexts which is part of what makes it so useful Let me give you a couple of business examples Take a look at the following words from Rob Austin austin in his insightful little book <cite> Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations austin1 < cite> > One frequent analogy casts the manager in the role of an airplane pilot guided by organizational measures that are like cockpit instruments > > Mechanistic and organic analogies are flawed because they are too simplistic Kaplan and Norton s cockpit analogy would be more accurate if it included a multitude of tiny gremlins controlling wing flaps fuel flow and so on of a plane being buffeted by winds and generally struggling against nature but with the gremlins always controlling information flow back to the cockpit instruments for fear that the pilot might find gremlin replacements It would not be surprising if airplanes guided this way occasionally flew into mountainsides when they seemed to be progressing smoothly toward their destinations Note that Rob starts with exterior perspectives of collectives a manager guiding an organization and a pilot flying an aircraft But then he goes on to expose the interior feeling fear of individuals who are not only being guided but being asked to objectively report the data on which their performance will be graded He then suggests the sort of culture interior such a collective of gremlins might develop in such conditions and what sort of collective behavior they might exhibit So while Austin may not have consciously or explicitly referred to the Four Quadrants model seeing his work as an example of this model may help us gain similarly powerful insights in other situations Example of Application from Liker Hoseus Here is another example from <cite> Toyota Culture The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way toyota culture < cite> by Jeffrey Liker and Mike Hoseus Here Mike tells a story of learning first hand some of the elements of the Toyota culture > As a new group leader I was sent to Tsutsumi to spend a month getting an appreciation of working on the line and mastering one process The team leaders told us no one would be able to complete the whole job by the end of the month but I was determined to prove them wrong I was installing liners underneath the wheel well when my air gun slipped and the driver bit scratched the paint on the inner lip of the wheel well I gasped and looked around no one saw me do it but they had told me to pull the andon rope cord if I made or caught any defect It was my moment of truth My first reaction was to let it go No one would probably see the scratch anyway and no one would know that I made it But my conscience got the best of me and I wanted to see if they really meant what they said about admitting mistakes So I pulled the andon and the team leader came to fix the problem and showed me how to hold the bit with a free finger in order to stabilize it better But he did not seem angry at me for making the scratch > > Then at break we gathered for our afternoon group meeting where the group leader gave out information on safety and quality issues and heard back concerns from the members > > They spoke Japanese so I could not understand what they were saying until I heard the words Mike san Well that got my attention so I listened carefully more Japanese and then scratchee scratchee and then more Japanese So here it was finally I was going to get called out for messing up and they were going to do it in front of everyone Then all of a sudden the whole group looked at me and clapped and smiled and patted my back and shook my hand as they headed back to the line I couldn t believe it after double checking with an interpreter just to make sure they were applauding me because I made a mistake and admitted it I felt like a million bucks and guess what I did the next time I made a mistake Notice how the story talks about individual behavior Exterior of an Individual group behavior Exterior of a Collective individual feelings Interior of an Individual and group culture Interior of a Collective And while these are four distinct perspectives they are all describing the same set of events Note also that while these are distinctly different perspectives they are not unrelated quite the opposite in fact Mike s story clearly shows how an individual and then a group responded to an event how the culture was evidenced by the group s behavior and then how that behavior made an individual feel which influenced his future feelings and behavior This is the beauty of the Four Quadrants model in that it gives us a complete picture of reality and increases our understanding of that reality Many lean transformation efforts fail for example because they are focused only on productivity improvements Exterior of a Collective and fail to instill the corresponding cultural elements necessary to support the desired behavior austin http www cbs dk en research departments and centres department of management politics and philosophy staff rampp
