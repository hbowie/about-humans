<p>Humans create culture, and humans can change culture. </p>

<p>So we might want to refer to this process of cultural adaptation as &#8220;cultural evolution.&#8221; </p>

<p>However we humans can use our <a href="we-have-powerful-imaginations.html" class="wiki-link">imaginations</a> to foresee (although not always accurately!) the consequences of our changes, so we have a leg up on the blind watchmaker. </p>

<p>Culture also has the advantage of being able to change much more rapidly than our genes, and so it a much speedier adaptation mechanism than <a href="we-adapt-via-genetic-evolution.html" class="wiki-link">genetic evolution</a>. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>As we are increasingly coming to realize, our species does represent a new evolutionary process — cultural evolution — that far surpasses cultural traditions in other species. This capacity for cultural evolution enabled our ancestors to spread over the globe, inhabiting all climatic zones and dozens of ecological niches. Then small-scale societies — &#8220;tiny grains of thought&#8221;" — coalesced into larger and larger societies over the past ten thousand years. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="wilson-david-sloan.html">Wilson, David Sloan</a>, 2019, from the Book <a href="this-view-of-life-completing-the-darwinian-revolution.html"><cite>This View of Life: Completing the Darwinian Revolution</cite></a></p>
