<p>The <a href="cynefin-framework.html" class="wiki-link">Cynefin Framework</a> was developed by <a href="snowden-dave.html" class="wiki-link">Dave Snowden</a> as a way of categorizing problems in terms of their characteristics and a broad recommended approach. The model consists of five domains into which a problem may be placed. </p>

<hr />
<main>
<details>
<summary>1. Confusion</summary>
<p><em>Characteristics</em>: Some issues and situations may be so confused and conflicted that they cannot be easily placed into one of the other categories. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Approach</em>: Break the overall problem down into a series of smaller parts, and then assign each part to one of the other domains. </p></details>

</main>
<main>
<details>
<summary>2. Clear</summary>
<p><em>Characteristics</em>: Situation is stable, causal relationships are clear, established rules or best practices are in place. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Approach</em>: Sense (determine the facts), Categorize (place the problem into an established category), Respond (following a reliable rule or best practice). </p></details>

</main>
<main>
<details>
<summary>3. Complicated</summary>
<p><em>Characteristics</em>: Situation is not entirely new, and is susceptible to analysis by established experts using a recognized body of knowledge, but there is no single right answer. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Approach</em>: Sense (determine the facts), Analyze (considering differing perspectives and tradeoffs), Respond (applying results of analysis). </p></details>

</main>
<main>
<details>
<summary>4. Complex</summary>
<p><em>Characteristics</em>: Situation is not well understood, and some experimentation will be needed to determine the best path forward. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Approach</em>: Probe (take some tentative action as an experiment, or as a means of further discovery), Sense (determine the facts), Respond (with probable best answer). </p></details>

</main>
<main>
<details>
<summary>5. Chaotic</summary>
<p><em>Characteristics</em>: Situation is deteriorating rapidly, problem is not yet understood, and immediate action is needed. </p>

<p><em>Recommended Approach</em>: Act (try something to improve the situation), Sense (observe how things change), Respond (in order to move the problem into another domain). </p></details>
