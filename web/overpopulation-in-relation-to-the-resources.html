<p>Despite its successes, and perhaps because of them, capitalism created, or could not prevent the creation of, the two problems that now threaten its survival: enormous economic inequalities both between and within countries, and the largely worsening if not the destruction of the natural environment. As we have analyzed in a previous chapter, the main cause of these problems is overpopulation in relation to the resources provided by the Earth. </p>
