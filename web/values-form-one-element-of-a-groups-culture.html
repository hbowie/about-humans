<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Sacred values differ from material or instrumental values in that they incorporate moral beliefs, such as the welfare of family, commitment to country, or identification with a particular religion that is thought to be absolute and inviolable. Sharing of these stories demonstrates honest reliable signals that an individual values the group and its goals. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the sharing of these sacred values is essential to the formation and maintenance of group identity. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="samson-david-r..html">David R. Samson</a>, 2023, from the book <cite><a href="our-tribal-future-how-to-channel-our-foundational-human-instincts-into-a-force-for-good.html">Our Tribal Future: How to Channel our Foundational Human Instincts Into a Force for Good</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends &#8211; hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism &#8211; these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="obama-barack.html">Barack Obama</a>, 2009, from the speech &ldquo;<a href="obamas-2009-inaugral-address.html">Obama's 2009 Inaugral Address</a>&rdquo;</p>
