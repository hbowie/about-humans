<p>The second thing we must recognize, if we are to make any progress at all in understanding ourselves, is that we are not a simple, straightforward species. </p>

<p>If anything, quite the opposite. </p>

<p>We are complex and often conflicted, and it is frequently a very confusing affair to try to make any sense of us at all. </p>

<p>However I will contend that this aspect of humanity is not a bug, but a feature: that is, we have been so successful in so many ways precisely because our feelings, thoughts and actions are not mechanistic and hard-wired, but instead are flexible and adaptive and creative. And it is this ability to come up with novel responses to new circumstances that has allowed us to survive and thrive so well as a species.  </p>

<p>So if you were hoping for a simple explanation of what makes us tick, I need to disappoint you right at the start. </p>

<p>But even though this journey of understanding may not be especially simple or straightforward, I do believe that it will be helpful and rewarding, if you stick with it, and approach it with an open mind. </p>

<blockquote><p>We are idealists and we are realists. We are dreamers and we are builders. We are experiencers and we are experimenters. We long for certainties, yet we ourselves are full of the ambiguities of the Mona Lisa and the I Ching. We ourselves are a part of the yin-yang of the world. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="lightman-alan.html">Alan Lightman</a>, 2018, from the Book <a href="searching-for-stars-on-an-island-in-maine.html"><cite>Searching for Stars on an Island in Maine</cite></a></p>

<blockquote><p>For me, for the filmmakers I came to love and respect, for my friends who started making movies around the same time that I did, cinema was about revelation — aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation. It was about characters — the complexity of people and their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="scorsese-martin.html">Martin Scorsese</a>, 2019-11-04, from the Essay <a href="martin-scorsese-i-said-marvel-movies-arent-cinema-let-me-explain..html">&ldquo;Martin Scorsese: I Said Marvel Movies Aren’t Cinema. Let Me Explain.&rdquo;</a></p>
