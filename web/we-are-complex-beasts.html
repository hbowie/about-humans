<p>The second thing we must recognize, if we are to make any progress at all in understanding ourselves, is that we are not a simple, straightforward species. </p>

<p>If anything, quite the opposite. </p>

<p>We are complex and often conflicted, and it is frequently a very confusing affair to try to make any sense of us at all. </p>

<p>However I will contend that this aspect of humanity is not a bug, but a feature: that is, we have been so successful in so many ways precisely because our feelings, thoughts and actions are not mechanistic and hard-wired, but instead are flexible and adaptive and creative. And it is this ability to come up with novel responses to new circumstances that has allowed us to survive and thrive so well as a species.  </p>

<p>So if you were hoping for a simple explanation of what makes us tick, I need to disappoint you right at the start. </p>

<p>But even though this journey of understanding may not be especially simple or straightforward, I do believe that it will be helpful and rewarding, if you stick with it, and approach it with an open mind. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Oh, there&#8217;s a thin line between Saturday night and Sunday morning. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="buffett-jimmy.html">Jimmy Buffett</a>, 1993, from the song &ldquo;<a href="fruitcakes.html">Fruitcakes</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>We are idealists and we are realists. We are dreamers and we are builders. We are experiencers and we are experimenters. We long for certainties, yet we ourselves are full of the ambiguities of the Mona Lisa and the I Ching. We ourselves are a part of the yin-yang of the world. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="lightman-alan.html">Alan Lightman</a>, 2018, from the book <cite><a href="searching-for-stars-on-an-island-in-maine.html">Searching for Stars on an Island in Maine</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Life is not like formula fiction. The villain has a heart, and the hero has great flaws. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="lamott-anne.html">Anne Lamott</a>, 1994, from the book <cite><a href="bird-by-bird-some-instructions-on-writing-and-life.html">Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>For me, for the filmmakers I came to love and respect, for my friends who started making movies around the same time that I did, cinema was about revelation — aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation. It was about characters — the complexity of people and their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="scorsese-martin.html">Martin Scorsese</a>, 04 Nov 2019, from the essay &ldquo;<a href="martin-scorsese-i-said-marvel-movies-arent-cinema-let-me-explain..html">Martin Scorsese: I Said Marvel Movies Aren’t Cinema. Let Me Explain.</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>The other part of me wanted to get out and stay out. But this was the part I never listened to. Because if I ever had I would have stayed in the town where I was born and worked in the hardware store and married the boss&#8217;s daughter and had five kids and read them the funny paper on Sunday morning and smacked their heads when they got out of line and squabbled with the wife about how much spending money they were to get and what programs they could have on the radio or TV set. I might even have got rich &#8211; small-town rich, an eight-room house, two cars in the garage, chicken every Sunday and the <em>Reader&#8217;s Digest</em> on the living room table, the wife with a cast iron permanent and me with a brain like a sack of Portland cement. You take it, friend. I&#8217;ll take the big sordid dirty crooked city. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="chandler-raymond.html">Raymond Chandler</a>, 1953, from the novel <cite><a href="the-long-goodbye.html">The Long Goodbye</a></cite></p>
