<p>Finally, we adapt to varying environments and situations through use of individual autonomy (which is also exercised by subgroups within groups). </p>

<p>Some might refer to this as <em>free will</em>. </p>

<p>Differing cultures may allow, encourage or discourage varying degrees of individual autonomy. </p>

<p>But all of us take advantage of some degree of autonomy. </p>

<p>And it is generally this means of adaptation that enables adaptation via <a href="we-adapt-via-cultural-change.html" class="wiki-link">cultural change</a>, since most changes in culture start with the exercise of autonomy by individuals. </p>

<blockquote><p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="jobs-steve.html">Jobs, Steve</a>, 1994, from the Interview <a href="steve-jobs-interview-with-santa-clara-valley-historical-association.html">&ldquo;Steve Jobs Interview with Santa Clara Valley Historical Association&rdquo;</a></p>
