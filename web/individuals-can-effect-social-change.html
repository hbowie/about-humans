<p>All of us are part of society, and all of us follow some established social norms, and all of us try to fit in with those around us. </p>

<p>But it is also we humans, as individuals, and as small like-minded groups, who  define social norms and create cultures. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Never doubt that a small, group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="mead-margaret.html">Margaret Mead</a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>There is a need now more than ever before for men and women in our nation to be creatively maladjusted. And I say to you that I choose to be among the maladjusted. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="king-martin-luther-jr..html">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, 31 Aug 1967, from the speech &ldquo;<a href="the-three-evils.html">The Three Evils</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="jobs-steve.html">Steve Jobs</a>, 1994, from the interview &ldquo;<a href="steve-jobs-interview-with-santa-clara-valley-historical-association.html">Steve Jobs Interview with Santa Clara Valley Historical Association</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>If something did go terribly wrong in human history  — and given the current state of the world, it’s hard to deny something did — then perhaps it began to go wrong precisely when people started losing that freedom to imagine and enact other forms of social existence, to such a degree that some now feel this particular type of freedom hardly even existed, or was barely exercised, for the greater part of human history. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="graeber-david-and-wengrow-david.html">David Graeber and David Wengrow</a>, 2021, from the book <cite><a href="the-dawn-of-everything-a-new-history-of-humanity.html">The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>One guy, he had nothing to do with the movies, but I&#8217;ve taken a lot of direction from him. That&#8217;s Bucky Fuller. Bucky, he&#8217;s most famous for the geodesic dome, but he made a great observation about these oceangoing tankers. And he noticed that the engineers were particularly challenged by how to turn this thing, you know? They got this big rudder, it took too much energy to turn the rudder to turn the ship. So they came up with a brilliant idea. Let&#8217;s put a little rudder on the big rudder. The little rudder will turn the big rudder, the big rudder will turn the ship. The little rudder is called a trim tab. </p>

<p>Bucky made the analogy that a trim tab is an example of how the individual is connected to society and how we affect society. And I like to think of myself as a trim tab. All of us are trim tabs. We might seem like we&#8217;re not up to the task, but we are, man. We&#8217;re alive! We can make a difference! We can turn this ship in the way we wanna go, man! Towards love, creating a healthy planet for all of us. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="bridges-jeff.html">Jeff Bridges</a></p>
