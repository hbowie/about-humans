<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Beavers build houses; but they build them in nowise differently, or better, now than they did five thousand years ago&#8230;. Man is not the only animal who labors; but he is the only one who improves his workmanship. These improvements he effects by Discoveries and Inventions. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="lincoln-abraham.html">Abraham Lincoln</a>, 1858, from the Lecture <a href="lecture-on-discoveries-and-inventions.html">&ldquo;Lecture on Discoveries and Inventions&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Don&#8217;t worry about what anybody else is going to do&#8230;. The best way to predict the future is to invent it. Really smart people with reasonable funding can do just about anything that doesn&#8217;t violate too many of Newton’s Laws. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="kay-alan.html">Alan Kay</a>, 1971, from the Remarks <a href="meeting-of-the-palo-alto-research-center.html">&ldquo;Meeting of the Palo Alto Research Center&rdquo;</a></p>
