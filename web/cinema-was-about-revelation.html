<p>Author: Martin Scorsese</p><p>Date: 04 Nov 2019 - Monday</p><blockquote>
<p>For me, for the filmmakers I came to love and respect, for my friends who started making movies around the same time that I did, cinema was about revelation — aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation. It was about characters — the complexity of people and their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves. </p>
