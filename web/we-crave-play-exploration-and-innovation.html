<p>These things can help prevent us from becoming <a href="we-are-easily-bored.html" class="wiki-link">bored</a>. </p>

<p>But these activities also help to invigorate our <a href="culture-provides-a-groups-operating-system.html" class="wiki-link">culture</a>. </p>

<p>And they are generally powered by our <a href="we-have-powerful-imaginations.html" class="wiki-link">imaginations</a>. </p>

<blockquote><p>The incidence of play is not associated with any particular stage of civilization or view of the universe. Any thinking person can see at a glance that play is a thing on its own, even if his language possesses no general concept to express it. Play cannot be denied. You can deny, if you like, nearly all abstractions: justice, beauty, truth, goodness, mind, God. You can deny seriousness, but not play. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="huizinga-johan.html">Huizinga, Johan</a>, 1938, from the Book <a href="homo-ludens-a-study-of-the-play-element-in-culture.html"><cite>Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture</cite></a></p>

<blockquote><p>That exploratory, expansive drive is what separates delight from demand: when we are in play mode, we are open to new surprises, while our base appetites focus the mind on the urgent needs of staying alive. Understanding that distinction is critical to understanding why play &#8211; despite its seemingly frivolous veneer &#8211; has led to so many important discoveries and innovations. The question of why the <em>Home sapiens</em> brain possesses this strange hankering for play and surprise is a fascinating one&#8230;. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="johnson-steven.html">Johnson, Steven</a>, 2016, from the Book <a href="wonderland-how-play-made-the-modern-world.html"><cite>Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World</cite></a></p>
