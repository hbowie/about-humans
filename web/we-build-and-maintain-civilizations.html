<p>At our best, we feel part of a civilization, a rich set of traditions and institutions that have been passed down to us, and from which we benefit, and to which we wish to contribute. </p>

<p>And, of course, it is we humans who have built, and are building, such civilizations. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>We have defined civilization as “social order promoting cultural creation.” It is political order secured through custom, morals, and law, and economic order secured through a continuity of production and exchange; it is cultural creation through freedom and facilities for the origination, expression, testing, and fruition of ideas, letters, manners, and arts. It is an intricate and precarious web of human relationships, laboriously built and readily destroyed. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="durant-will.html">Will Durant</a>, 1968, from the book <cite><a href="the-lessons-of-history.html">The Lessons of History</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>We were not aware that civilization was a thin and precarious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules and conventions skilfully put across and guilefully preserved. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="keynes-john-maynard.html">John Maynard Keynes</a>, 1938, from the essay &ldquo;<a href="my-early-beliefs.html">My Early Beliefs</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, economic exploitation, and militarism are incapable of being conquered. A civilization can flounder as readily in the face of moral bankruptcy as it can through financial bankruptcy. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="king-martin-luther-jr..html">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, 31 Aug 1967, from the speech &ldquo;<a href="the-three-evils.html">The Three Evils</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people &#8211; first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving&#8230;. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="einstein-albert.html">Albert Einstein</a>, 1949, from the book <cite><a href="the-world-as-i-see-it.html">The World As I See It</a></cite></p>
