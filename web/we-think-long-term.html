<em>Words from Others on this Topic</em></summary>

<blockquote><p>In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="iroquois-nation.html">Iroquois Nation</a>, from <a href="great-law-of-the-iroquois.html"><cite>Great Law of the Iroquois</cite></a></p>

<blockquote><p>I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="adams-john.html">John Adams</a>, 1780-05-12, from the Letter <a href="letter-to-abigail-adams.html">&ldquo;Letter to Abigail Adams&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Many people interpret the invisible hand concept as saying, we should just take our hands off the steering wheel like there’s nothing we should do.  I don’t agree with that.  Humans aren’t designed to accept the world as is, so to just say “whatever” is denying what makes us thrive as a species.  More than any other creature on Earth, we have the capacity to envision a better future and make it a reality.  We are askers of the question, “What kind of world do we want?” And perhaps even more importantly, we can ask the follow-up question, “How do we build that?” </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="hwang-victor.html">Victor Hwang</a>, 2023-08-03, from the Interview <a href="evolution-complexity-and-the-third-way-of-entrepreneurship-a-capstone-conversation-with-victor-hwang.html">&ldquo;Evolution, Complexity, and the Third Way of Entrepreneurship: A Capstone Conversation with Victor Hwang&rdquo;</a></p>
