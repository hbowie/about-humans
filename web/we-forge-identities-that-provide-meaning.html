<p>Each human develops an identity for themselves, and it is these identities that make our lives meaningful. </p>

<p>Our identity answers the questions: <em>Who am I? How do I fit in? Where do I belong? Who are my people? How do I contribute? Why am I here?</em> </p>

<p>This drive to establish and maintain identity is probably the primary determinant for most of our human behavior. </p>

<p>This assertion appears counterintuitive because identity by itself seems to have little intrinsic value, and directly satisfies few if any of our most basic needs. </p>

<p>And yet identity is a powerful proxy for our ability to acquire those things that <em>do</em> have intrinsic value, such as food, shelter, respect and love. </p>

<p>For most other species, an organism’s identity is largely determined by its genetic makeup. </p>

<p>But with humans our genes provide only a large range of possibilities and capabilities, with all the most important elements of our identities determined after our birth, through a process of gradual development and discovery and association. </p>

<p>As just one example, all humans have the capacity for language, but <em>which</em> language we learn (and so, which set of fellow humans we can easily live and work with) is determined, not by our genes, but by our upbringing. </p>

<p>A human without any identity is something like a computer without an operating system: it presents lots of interesting possibilities, but it’s not actually functional in any meaningful way. </p>

<p>Our human identities seem to be composed of elements from the following sources: </p>
<ol>
<li>Our relationships with <a href="family-is-the-foundational-paradigm.html" class="wiki-link">family</a> and <a href="friends-and-colleagues-expand-the-circle.html" class="wiki-link">friends</a> (our <em>kith and kin</em>); </li>
<li>Our associations with other humans, and the group(s) to which we belong, and the cultural elements that we share (our <em><a href="tribes-organize-even-larger-groups.html" class="wiki-link">tribes</a></em>); </li>
<li>Our participation in groups working together to achieve a shared goal (our <em>teams</em>); </li>
<li>The features of the land on which we were raised, and on which we reside (our <em>homeland</em>); </li>
<li>The expertise we have acquired, and the set of tools with which we have become proficient (our <em>trade</em>). </li>
</ol>

<p>Identities ideally help to connect the <a href="we-each-manage-four-interrelated-realms.html" class="wiki-link">four realms</a> we each need to manage: the physical world, our social relationships, our physical bodies and our inner worlds. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>We are desperately needy. We need a place to stand, and a people to stand with, and a cause to stand for. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="zeiders-ed.html">Ed Zeiders</a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="harari-yuval-noah.html">Yuval Noah Harari</a>, 2015, from the Book <a href="sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind.html"><cite>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</cite></a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="frankl-victor.html">Victor Frankl</a>, 1946, from the Book <a href="mans-search-for-meaning.html"><cite>Man's Search for Meaning</cite></a></p>
