<p>I. <a href="the-basics.html" class="nav-link">The Basics </a>&#160;&#8593;</p><h3 id="weforgeidentitiesthatprovidemeaning" style="clear:both">15. We forge identities for ourselves that provide meaning in our lives.</h3>
<p>Each human develops an identity for themselves, and it is these identities that make our lives meaningful. </p>

<p>Our identity answers the questions: <em>Who am I? How do I fit in? Where do I belong? Who are my people? How do I contribute? Why am I here?</em> </p>

<p>This drive to establish and maintain identity is probably the primary determinant for most of our human behavior. </p>

<p>This assertion appears counterintuitive because identity by itself seems to have little intrinsic value, and directly satisfies few if any of our most basic needs. </p>

<p>And yet identity is a powerful proxy for our ability to acquire those things that <em>do</em> have intrinsic value, such as food, shelter, respect and love. </p>

<p>For most other species, an organism’s identity is largely determined by its genetic makeup. </p>

<p>But with humans our genes provide only a large range of possibilities and capabilities, with all the most important elements of our identities determined after our birth, through a process of gradual development and discovery and association. </p>

<p>As just one example, all humans have the capacity for language, but <em>which</em> language we learn (and so, which set of fellow humans we can easily live and work with) is determined, not by our genes, but by our upbringing. </p>

<p>A human without any identity is something like a computer without an operating system: it presents lots of interesting possibilities, but it’s not actually functional in any meaningful way. </p>

<p>Our human identities seem to be composed of elements from the following sources: </p>
<ol>
<li>
Our relationships with <a href="family-is-the-foundational-paradigm.html" class="wiki-link">family</a> and <a href="friends-and-colleagues-expand-the-circle.html" class="wiki-link">friends</a> (our <em>kith and kin</em>); </li>
<li>
Our associations with other humans, and the group(s) to which we belong, and the cultural elements that we share (our <em><a href="tribes-organize-even-larger-groups.html" class="wiki-link">tribes</a></em>); </li>
<li>
Our participation in groups working together to achieve a shared goal (our <em>teams</em>); </li>
<li>
The features of the land on which we were raised, and on which we reside (our <em>homeland</em>); </li>
<li>
The expertise we have acquired, and the set of tools with which we have become proficient (our <em>trade</em>); </li>
<li>
Our accomplishments, especially when tied to one or more of the first five elements. </li>
</ol>

<p>Identities ideally help to connect the <a href="we-each-manage-four-interrelated-realms.html" class="wiki-link">four realms</a> we each need to manage: the physical world, our social relationships, our physical bodies and our inner worlds. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>We are desperately needy. We need a place to stand, and a people to stand with, and a cause to stand for. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="zeiders-ed.html">Ed Zeiders</a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>A meaningful activity is oriented toward a goal, one that, if accomplished, would have an impact on the world — and this usually means that it has an impact on other people. This activity extends across a significant portion of one’s life and has some structure — it’s the sort of thing that one can tell a story about. It often connects to religion and spirituality and often connects to flow (leading to the experience of self-loss) and often brings you into close contact with other people and is often seen as morally virtuous — but none of these additional features are essential. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="bloom-paul.html">Paul Bloom</a>, 2022, from the book <cite><a href="the-sweet-spot.html">The Sweet Spot</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="harari-yuval-noah.html">Yuval Noah Harari</a>, 2015, from the book <cite><a href="sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind.html">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>We are all aware, if we have ever tried it, how empty and ghostly is a life lived for a long while in absolute solitude. Free me from my fellows, let me alone to work out the salvation of my own glorious self, and surely (so I may fancy) I shall now for the first time show who I am. No, not so; on the contrary I merely show in such a case who I am not. I am no longer friend, brother, companion, co-worker, servant, citizen, father, son; I exist for nobody; and ere-long, perhaps to my surprise, generally to my horror, I discover that I <em>am</em> nobody. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="royce-josiah.html">Josiah Royce</a>, from the lecture &ldquo;<a href="lecture-on-hegel.html">Lecture on Hegel</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="frankl-victor.html">Victor Frankl</a>, 1946, from the book <cite><a href="mans-search-for-meaning.html">Man's Search for Meaning</a></cite></p>
