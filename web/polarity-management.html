<img src="images/polarity-management-template.png" alt="" class="notenik-image" /><p>Polarity management is an approach to achieving a productive balance between opposing values, or concerns. </p>

<p>The approach was originally devised and named by <a href="johnson-barry.html" class="wiki-link">Barry Johnson</a>, who began teaching and applying it in 1975. </p>

<p>The seminal book on the subject is <em><a href="polarity-management-identifying-and-managing-unsolvable-problems.html" class="wiki-link">Polarity Management: Identifying and Managing Unsolvable Problems</a></em>, by Johnson. </p>

<p>The key tool used in this approach is the Polarity Map&reg;, as loosely depicted in the diagram above. </p>

<p>Polarity Map® is a registered trademark of Barry Johnson &amp; <a href="https://www.polaritypartnerships.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polarity Partnerships, LLC</a>. </p>

<p>One of the classic polarities, in a business context, is centralization vs. decentralization of decision-making. </p>

<p>Both &#8220;poles&#8221; have advantages and disadvantages. </p>

<p>If the balance has swung too far in one direction, perhaps in the direction of decentalization, then the answer to all of your problems may appear to be centralization and standardization. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if an organization allows itself to become too centralized, then lower-level managers may lack the freedom to respond productively to local situations. </p>

<p>So the best approach is to recognize and embrace the polarity, constantly looking for ways to maximize the upsides and minimize the downsides. </p>
