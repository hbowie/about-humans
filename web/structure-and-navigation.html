<p><em>Important Things to Know About Humans</em> is a web-based book. </p>

<p>It is like a traditional book, in the sense that it is meant to cover a subject of enduring interest in some depth, and is presented primarily in a linear fashion, without advertising interruptions. It also has many of the traditional elements of a book, such as a <a href="table-of-contents.html" class="wiki-link">Table of Contents</a>. a <a href="bibliography.html" class="wiki-link">Bibliography</a>, and an <a href="index-of-names-and-topics.html" class="wiki-link">Index</a>. </p>

<p>However it is also web-based, which means: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Anyone with access to the web can read the book whenever they like, at no cost, and with no restrictions; </li>
<li>
It can be improved and updated as needed, without any printing costs, quickly and expeditiously offering all readers the latest version; </li>
<li>
Each page has its own web address, and so can be easily referenced; </li>
<li>
Hyperlinks allow the reader to easily hop around within the book, as well as to other web resources outside of the book; </li>
<li>
A <a href="search.html" class="wiki-link">Search</a> feature is available; </li>
<li>
There is also a page that can be used to jump to a <a href="random-thing-to-know.html" class="wiki-link">Random Thing to Know</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few navigational features that might benefit from some brief description: </p>
<ul>
<li>
The title of the book appears at the top of every page, and you can always click on this to take you back to the title page; </li>
<li>
For pages that are organized hierarchically (as in the <a href="bibliography.html" class="wiki-link">Bibliography</a> or the <a href="reference-models.html" class="wiki-link">Reference Models</a> section), you will find the title of the parent page just below the book title and to the left, and clicking here will take you to that parent page; </li>
<li>
Just below the book title and to the right you will find links to the Table of Contents, the Index, and the Search page, so these are always within easy reach; </li>
<li>
At the bottom of each page you will find a link to take you to the next page, in the normal reading sequence. </li>
</ul>
