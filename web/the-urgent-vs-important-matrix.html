<img src="images/the-urgent-vs-important-matrix-diagram.png.png" alt="" class="notenik-image" /><p>Author: Stephen Covey</p><p>This is a tool to help manage the allocation of resources to tasks. </p>

<p>You will also sometimes see this referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_method" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eisenhower Matrix</a>, and will sometimes see it credited to <a href="covey-stephen.html" class="wiki-link">Stephen Covey</a>, who helped to popularize it. </p>

<p>The four quadrants of the model are formed along the two dimensions of importance and urgency. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s review what we mean by the two key terms here. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>urgent</em>: requiring immediate action or attention; this may be in response to a critical situation, or to an externally imposed deadline or expectation. </p></li>
<li>
<p><em>important</em>: of great significance or value; likely to have a profound effect on success, survival, or well-being. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, with these definitions in mind, what can we recommend for tasks that fall into each of the quadrants? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quad I: Important and Urgent &#8211; In the short term, you must do these items first; in the bigger picture, you should manage your situation so that you do not spend all of your resources in this quadrant. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Quad II: Important but Not Urgent &#8211; In the short term, you should make plans to work on these items; at some point, you must be able to focus necessary resources on these items without constant interruptions from more urgent items. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Quad III: Urgent but Not Important &#8211; In the short term, try to find someone else to take such an item on; in the bigger picture, such items should be avoided, since the urgency would seem to be contrived or imagined. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Quad IV: Neither Urgent Nor Important &#8211; Eliminate these items whenever you can; if you can&#8217;t entirely eliminate them, then at least limit them. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the typical challenge here is to limit the volume and frequency of urgent items in order to focus necessary resources on the items that are important but not urgent. </p>
