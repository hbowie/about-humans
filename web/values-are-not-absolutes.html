<em>Words from Others on this Topic</em></summary>

<blockquote><p>Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. But this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are culture&#8217;s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. Just as when two clashing musical notes played together force a piece of music forward, so discord in our thoughts, ideas and values compel us to think, re-evaluate and criticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="harari-yuval-noah.html">Yuval Noah Harari</a>, 2015, from the Book <a href="sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind.html"><cite>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</cite></a></p>

<blockquote><p>What’s good about an individual human life can’t be boiled down to any single value. It’s not all about beauty or all about justice or all about happiness. Pluralist theories are more plausible, postulating a variety of relevant values, including human well-being, justice, fairness, beauty, the artistic peaks of human achievement, the quality of mercy, and the many different and, indeed, sometimes contrasting kinds of happiness. Life is complicated! </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="cowen-tyler.html">Tyler Cowen</a></p>
