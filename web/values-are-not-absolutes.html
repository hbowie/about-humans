<p>A culture&#8217;s values are not absolute, and are often in tension with one another. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. But this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are culture&#8217;s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. Just as when two clashing musical notes played together force a piece of music forward, so discord in our thoughts, ideas and values compel us to think, re-evaluate and criticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="harari-yuval-noah.html">Harari, Yuval Noah</a>, 2015, from the Book <a href="sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind.html"><cite>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</cite></a></p>
