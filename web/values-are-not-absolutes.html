<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>In Pauline and Mal&#8217;s house, nothing was simple. In her parents&#8217; house, things had been good or bad, right or wrong, useful or wasteful. There had been nothing in between. Here, she found, everything had nuance; everything had an unrevealed side or unexplored depths. Everything was worth looking at more closely. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="ng-celeste.html">Celeste Ng</a>, 2017, from the novel <cite><a href="little-fires-everywhere.html">Little Fires Everywhere</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Morals are the rules by which a society exhorts (as laws are the rules by which it seeks to compel) its members and associations to behavior consistent with its order, security, and growth. A little knowledge of history stresses the variability of moral codes, and concludes that they are negligible because they differ in time and place, and sometimes contradict each other. A larger knowledge stresses the universality of moral codes, and concludes to their necessity. </p>

<p>Moral codes differ because they adjust themselves to historical and environmental conditions. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="durant-will.html">Will Durant</a>, 1968, from the book <cite><a href="the-lessons-of-history.html">The Lessons of History</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. But this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are culture&#8217;s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. Just as when two clashing musical notes played together force a piece of music forward, so discord in our thoughts, ideas and values compel us to think, re-evaluate and criticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="harari-yuval-noah.html">Yuval Noah Harari</a>, 2015, from the book <cite><a href="sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind.html">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>What’s good about an individual human life can’t be boiled down to any single value. It’s not all about beauty or all about justice or all about happiness. Pluralist theories are more plausible, postulating a variety of relevant values, including human well-being, justice, fairness, beauty, the artistic peaks of human achievement, the quality of mercy, and the many different and, indeed, sometimes contrasting kinds of happiness. Life is complicated! </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="cowen-tyler.html">Tyler Cowen</a></p>
