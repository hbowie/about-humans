<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>I consider myself a realist. I have certainly seen my share of the world as it really is and not how I wish it would be. What I&#8217;ve learned is that it is foolish to view realism and idealism as incompatible or to consider our power and wealth as encumbered by the demands of justice, morality and conscience. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="buffett-warren.html">Warren Buffett</a>, 26 Nov 2006, from the interview &ldquo;<a href="in-class-warfare-guess-which-class-is-winning.html">In Class Warfare, Guess Which Class Is Winning</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Since we have the rare good fortune to live in a commonwealth where the freedom of judgment is fully granted to the individual citizen and he may worship God as he pleases, and where nothing is esteemed dearer and more precious than freedom, I think I am undertaking no ungrateful or unprofitable task in demonstrating that not only can this freedom be granted without endangering piety and the peace of the commonwealth, but also the peace of the commonwealth and piety depend on this freedom. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="spinoza-baruch.html">Baruch Spinoza</a>, 1670, from the book <cite><a href="tractatus-theologico-politicus.html">Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</a></cite></p>
