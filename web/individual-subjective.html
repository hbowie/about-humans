<h5 id="individualsubjective" style="clear:both">1. Individual Subjective</h5>
<p>Each of us experiences a complex inner world of sensations, emotions, thoughts and feelings. </p>

<p>And while others may report having similar feelings &#8211; or very different ones &#8211; no one else can actually experience our inner world in the same way that we can. </p>

<p>These inner experiences can vary from the mundane &#8211; hunger, pain, fear &#8211; to the sublime &#8211; wonder, love, reverence. </p>

<p>The inner experiences that we have can be highly individual &#8211; you and I may have very different inner reactions to something happening in the world around us. </p>

<p>And the relationships between external stimuli and our inner feelings can sometimes be obvious,  but at other times rather complex and even mysterious. </p>

<p>When considering the multiple perspectives we can take regarding a thing, some of these viewpoints may fairly be considered subjective. </p>

<p>This is not to imply that subjective views are invalid, or unworthy of consideration &#8211; far from it. </p>

<p>The Individual Subjective is depicted in the upper left quadrant of the Four Quadrants diagram, and so is sometimes referred to simply as <em>UL</em>. </p>
