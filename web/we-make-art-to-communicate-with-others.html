<h3 id="wemakearttocommunicatewithothers" style="clear:both">39. We make art to communicate with others</h3>
<p>We make works of art in order to communicate with others. </p>

<p>Many works of art incorporate <a href="we-share-stories.html" class="wiki-link">stories</a>, or elements of stories. </p>

<p>Art is a form of human communication. It’s a way for a specific, unique individual to communicate a very nuanced set of thoughts, feelings and perspectives to a broad audience, and to elicit some resonant and sympathetic response from those viewing/hearing/reading the created work. </p>

<p>Genuine works of art have some sort of depth to them: meaningful elements that lie beneath the surface of the work, waiting for the observer to discover them. In this way, art calls forth and rewards deeper sorts of attention. </p>
