<p>We make works of art in order to communicate with others. </p>

<p>Many works of art incorporate <a href="we-share-stories.html" class="wiki-link">stories</a>, or elements of stories. </p>

<p>Art is a form of human communication. It’s a way for a specific, unique individual to communicate a very nuanced set of thoughts, feelings and perspectives to a broad audience, and to elicit some resonant and sympathetic response from those viewing/hearing/reading the created work. </p>

<p>Genuine works of art have some sort of depth to them: meaningful elements that lie beneath the surface of the work, waiting for the observer to discover them. In this way, art calls forth and rewards <a href="deep-attention-satisfies-and-delivers.html" class="wiki-link">deep attention</a>. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="bernstein-leonard.html">Leonard Bernstein</a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Poetry is&#8230; words that are empowered that make your hair stand on end&#8230; that you recognize instantly as being some form of subjective truth that has an objective reality to it&#8230; because somebody&#8217;s realized it. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="ginsberg-allen.html">Allen Ginsberg</a>, 2005, from the film <cite><a href="no-direction-home.html">No Direction Home</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="brecht-bertolt.html">Bertolt Brecht</a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>The excitement we derive from a work of art is mostly the excitement of seeing connections that did not exist before, of seeing quite different aspects of life unified through a pattern. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="burgess-anthony.html">Anthony Burgess</a>, 1974, from the book <cite><a href="english-literature-a-survey-for-students.html">English Literature: A Survey for Students</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>I really believe that art is capable of the total transformation of the world, and of life itself, and nothing less is really acceptable. So I mean if art is going to have any excuse for &#8211; beyond being a leisure-class plaything &#8211; it has to transform life itself. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="ferlinghetti-lawrence.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>It&#8217;s all the reasons why human psychology will never be fully explained or pictured by scientific investigation — there are just too many variables, too many vectors pressing in on every incident. It&#8217;s the reason why storytelling and songwriting and poetry-making will always be so much more effective organizers and vehicles of our experience than studies in social science. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="gopnik-adam.html">Adam Gopnik</a>, 2024, from the book <cite><a href="all-that-happiness-is.html">All That Happiness Is</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Men are not suffering from the lack of good literature, good art, good theatre, good music, but from that which has made it impossible for these to become manifest. In short, they are suffering from the silent, shameful conspiracy (the more shameful since it is unacknowledged) which has bound them together as enemies of art and artist. They are suffering from the fact that art is not the primary moving force in their lives. They are suffering from the act, repeated daily, of keeping up the pretense that they can go their way, lead their lives, without art. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="miller-henry.html">Henry Miller</a>, 1957, from the book <cite><a href="big-sur-and-the-oranges-of-hieronymus-bosch.html">Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch</a></cite></p>
