<p>We humans tend to form long-term bonds with mates, and such couples often have children and jointly take responsibility for raising them. </p>

<p>Families generally provide mutual aid to their members, and provide parenting for their offspring. </p>

<p>Family members generally feel strong bonds of love for each other. </p>

<p>Partners often exhibit some degree of specialization of roles within the family unit. </p>
