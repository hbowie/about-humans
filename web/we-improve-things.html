<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>The cause which is blocking all progress today is the subtle scepticism which whispers in a million ears that things are not good enough to be worth improving. If the world is good we are revolutionaries, if the world is evil we must be conservatives. These essays, futile as they are considered as serious literature, are yet ethically sincere, since they seek to remind men that things must be loved first and improved afterwards. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="chesterton-g-k..html">G. K. Chesterton</a>, 1902, from the book <cite><a href="the-defendant.html">The Defendant</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Search for what is good and strong and beautiful in your society and elaborate from there. Push outward. Always create from what you already have. Then you will know what to do. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="foucault-michel.html">Michel Foucault</a></p>
