<p>The <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em> defines &#8220;wonder&#8221; as: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>a feeling of surprise mingled with admiration, caused by something beautiful, unexpected, unfamiliar, or inexplicable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And part of being human is to experience this sense of wonder about the universe around us. </p>

<p>As we grow and develop, things that once seemed wonderful to us might over time become well known and routine. </p>

<p>And yet&#8230; </p>

<p>No matter how much we learn, how much we develop, wonder always seems to be still available to us, when we stop to look for it. </p>

<p>Because the cosmos — including we humans who occupy one small corner of it — is always in some sense larger and more complex — has more <em>breadth</em> and <em>depth</em> to it — than any one of us can ever fully absorb. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Philosophy begins in wonder. And, at the end, when philosophic thought has done its best, the wonder remains. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="whitehead-alfred-north.html">Alfred North Whitehead</a>, 1938, from the book <cite><a href="modes-of-thought.html">Modes of Thought</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>To see a world in a grain of sand  <br />
And heaven in a wild flower  <br />
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand  <br />
And eternity in an hour. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="blake-william.html">William Blake</a>, 1863, from the poem &ldquo;<a href="auguries-of-innocence.html">Auguries of Innocence</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>A mind is blown when something you always feared but knew to be impossible turns out to be true; when the world turns out far vaster, far more marvelous or malevolent than you ever dreamed; when you get proof that everything is connected to everything else, that everything you know is wrong, that you are both the center of the universe and a tiny speck sailing off its nethermost edge. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="chabon-michael.html">Michael Chabon</a>, 2004, from the speech &ldquo;<a href="chabon-keynote-at-eisner-awards.html">Chabon Keynote at Eisner Awards</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we <em>can</em> suppose. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="haldane-j-b-s..html">J. B. S. Haldane</a>, 1927, from the book <cite><a href="possible-worlds-and-other-essays.html">Possible Worlds and Other Essays</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>The world is a wonderfully weird place, consensual reality is significantly flawed, no institution can be trusted, certainty is a mirage, security a delusion, and the tyranny of the dull mind forever threatens &#8211; but our lives are not as limited as we think they are, all things are possible, laughter is holier than piety, freedom is sweeter than fame, and in the end it&#8217;s love and love alone that really matters. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="robbins-tom.html">Tom Robbins</a>, 2007, from the interview &ldquo;<a href="gracie-goes-to-schooner-school.html">Gracie Goes to Schooner School</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>When our first encounter with some object takes us by surprise, and we judge it to be new, or very different from what we have previously experienced or from what we expected it to be, this causes us to wonder at it and be astonished. And because this can happen before we have any knowledge of whether the thing is beneficial to us or not, it seems to me that wonderment is the first passion of all. And it has no contrary, because, if the object that presents itself has nothing in itself to surprise us, we are not moved by it in any way and we consider it without any passion. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="descartes-rené.html">René Descartes</a>, 1649, from the book <cite><a href="passions-of-the-soul.html">Passions of the Soul</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>I don’t mean to suggest that we have the final answers; we are bathing in mystery and confusion on many subjects, and I think that will always be our destiny. The universe will always be much richer than our ability to understand it. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="sagan-carl.html">Carl Sagan</a>, 1980, from the book <cite><a href="conversations-with-carl-sagan.html">Conversations with Carl Sagan</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Down in the meadow by the river rapids, by the tumble of wet boulders, a large woodpecker was drumming on a hollow tree. A buzzard eagle soared past the vertical face of a red pinnacle. Warm late-morning air currents were stirring the woods along the road, creating a tapestry of light and shadow so fine-grained and chaotic in its shiftings that no computer on earth could have modeled it. Nature even on the most local of scales made a mockery of information technology. Even augmented by tech, the human brain was paltry, infinitesimal, in comparison to the universe. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="franzen-jonathan.html">Jonathan Franzen</a>, 2015, from the novel <cite><a href="purity.html">Purity</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>If you&#8217;re picking colors based on a Pantone book, you&#8217;re limited to a certain number of choices. If you step out in nature, the palette is infinite. Each rock has such a variation of color within it, we could never find a can of paint to mimic the exact same shade. </p>

<p>Nature transcends our tendencies to label and classify, to reduce and limit. The natural world is unfathomably more rich, interwoven, and complicated than we are taught, and so much more mysterious and beautiful. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="rubin-rick.html">Rick Rubin</a>, 2023, from the book <cite><a href="the-creative-act-a-way-of-being.html">The Creative Act: A Way of Being</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>One of the deepest and strangest of all human moods is the mood which will suddenly strike us perhaps in a garden at night, or deep in sloping meadows, the feeling that every flower and leaf has just uttered something stupendously direct and important, and that we have by a prodigy of imbecility not heard or understood it. There is a certain poetic value, and that a genuine one, in this sense of having missed the full meaning of things. There is beauty, not only in wisdom, but in this dazed and dramatic ignorance. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="chesterton-g-k..html">G. K. Chesterton</a>, 1903, from <cite><a href="robert-browning.html">Robert Browning</a></cite></p>
