<p>The <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em> defines &#8220;wonder&#8221; as: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>a feeling of surprise mingled with admiration, caused by something beautiful, unexpected, unfamiliar, or inexplicable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And part of being human is to experience this sense of wonder about the universe around us. </p>

<p>As we grow and develop, things that once seemed wonderful to us might over time become well known and routine. </p>

<p>And yet&#8230; </p>

<p>No matter how much we learn, how much we develop, wonder always seems to be still available to us, when we stop to look for it. </p>

<p>Because the cosmos — including we humans who occupy one small corner of it — is always in some sense larger and more complex — has more <em>breadth</em> and <em>depth</em> to it — than any one of us can ever fully absorb. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>To see a world in a grain of sand  <br />
And heaven in a wild flower  <br />
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand  <br />
And eternity in an hour. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="blake-william.html">William Blake</a>, 1863, from the poem &ldquo;<a href="auguries-of-innocence.html">Auguries of Innocence</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>A mind is blown when something you always feared but knew to be impossible turns out to be true; when the world turns out far vaster, far more marvelous or malevolent than you ever dreamed; when you get proof that everything is connected to everything else, that everything you know is wrong, that you are both the center of the universe and a tiny speck sailing off its nethermost edge. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="chabon-michael.html">Michael Chabon</a>, 2004, from the speech &ldquo;<a href="chabon-keynote-at-eisner-awards.html">Chabon Keynote at Eisner Awards</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>One of the deepest and strangest of all human moods is the mood which will suddenly strike us perhaps in a garden at night, or deep in sloping meadows, the feeling that every flower and leaf has just uttered something stupendously direct and important, and that we have by a prodigy of imbecility not heard or understood it. There is a certain poetic value, and that a genuine one, in this sense of having missed the full meaning of things. There is beauty, not only in wisdom, but in this dazed and dramatic ignorance. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="chesterton-g-k..html">G. K. Chesterton</a>, 1903, from <cite><a href="robert-browning.html">Robert Browning</a></cite></p>
