<p>This is an objective view, not of a single individual, but of a collective, or what we might call a society, including observations of social systems as members of the society interact with each other. </p>

<p>This is the perspective we take when viewing a human society from the exterior. This might include observation of their rituals, their institutions, their means of communication and means of value exchange. </p>

<p>This is sometimes called an <em>interobjective</em> perspective. </p>

<p>The Social Objective is depicted in the lower right quadrant of the diagram, and so is sometimes referred to simply as <em>LR</em>. </p>
