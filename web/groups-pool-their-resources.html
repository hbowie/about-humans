<p>Members of groups often pool some of their resources, so that the group manages the shared resources for the good of its members. </p>

<p>Another way to express this idea is by saying that human societies tend to favor some mix of both public and private property. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Most things that people buy in stores give them a lot of satisfaction the moment they buy them. But after a few days, that satisfaction decreases, and months later, it completely melts away. But great public space is a kind of magical good. It never ceases to yield happiness. It’s almost happiness itself. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="peñalosa-enrique.html">Enrique Peñalosa</a>, from <cite><a href="happy-city-transforming-our-lives-through-urban-design.html">Happy City: Transforming our Lives through Urban Design</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Most needed are those &#8216;third places&#8217; which lend a public balance to the increased privatization of home life. Third places are nothing more than informal public gathering places. The phrase &#8216;third places&#8217; derives from considering our homes to be the &#8216;first&#8217; places in our lives, and our work places the &#8216;second.&#8217; </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="oldenburg-ray.html">Ray Oldenburg</a>, 1989, from the book <cite><a href="the-great-good-place.html">The Great Good Place</a></cite></p>
