<p>Humans share stories with each other. </p>

<p>These can be quite simple tales, or very complex narratives. </p>

<p>And stories can be told and recorded using a variety of media. </p>

<p>A story generally includes the following elements: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Setting; </li>
<li>
Situation; </li>
<li>
Character; </li>
<li>
Actions; </li>
<li>
Consequences. </li>
</ul>

<p>Stories often embody a group&#8217;s <a href="values.html" class="wiki-link">values</a>, and form important elements of their <a href="cultures.html" class="wiki-link">cultures</a>. </p>

<p>Stories often feature the exploits and accomplishments of heroes. </p>

<p>Stories can also be useful to broaden the perspectives of the listeners/readers. </p>

<p>But good stories are also fun and engaging, providing <a href="we-appreciate-novelty.html" class="wiki-link">novelty</a> in our lives. </p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>The dullness of fact is the mother of fiction. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="asimov-isaac.html">Isaac Asimov</a>, 1962, from the book <cite><a href="fact-and-fancy.html">Fact and Fancy</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors. We realize it best when we talk with an unliterary friend. He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world. In it, we should be suffocated. The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="lewis-c-s..html">C. S. Lewis</a>, 1961, from the book <cite><a href="an-experiment-in-criticism.html">An Experiment in Criticism</a></cite></p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old&#8217;s life: The <cite>Lord of the Rings</cite> and <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="rogers-john.html">John Rogers</a>, 2009, from the blog post &ldquo;<a href="kung-fu-monkey-ephemera-2009-7.html">Kung Fu Monkey - Ephemera 2009 (7)</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="attribution-following"><p>It&#8217;s only recently that I&#8217;ve come to understand that writers are not marginal to our society, that they, in fact, do all our thinking for us, that we are writing myths and our myths are believed, and that old myths are believed until someone writes a new one. </p></blockquote><p class="quote-from"><a href="vonnegut-kurt.html">Kurt Vonnegut</a>, 1974, from the interview &ldquo;<a href="wnyc-readers-almanac-vonnegut-interview.html">WNYC Reader's Almanac - Vonnegut Interview</a>&rdquo;</p>
